second room from the left and the next-to-last room from the right.", "3.", "There are two Renaissance art pieces, but one of them isn't on a wall between two other Renaissance artworks.", "4.", "The Modernism artwork at either end isn't adjacent to any Baroque artwork.", "5.", "The painting directly next to the Baroque painting is from the same era as this painting.", "Question: Determine the style and position of each piece in each room.", "Let's start with the second clue, the baroque painting is in the second room from the left (2nd) and the next-to-last room from the right (4th).", "Since there are five rooms, this means the Renaissance artwork must be on the far right and the Modernism art piece on the far left.", "So we have: \n1st Room: Modernism\n2nd Room: Baroque\n3rd Room: \n4th Room: Baroque\n5th Room: Renaissance\n\n\nThe first clue indicates that the Renaissance artwork is to the left of the Modernism piece but it's not in the first room.", "So, we can place the Renaissance piece in the 3rd or 4th room and since the Renaissance piece cannot be next to any other Renaissance artworks (clue 3), it must be in the 5th room which has the Renaissance artwork.", "So we have: \n1st Room: Modernism\n2nd Room: Baroque\n3rd Room: Renaissance\n4th Room: Baroque\n5th Room: Renaissance\n\n\nThe clue 4 indicates that both artworks at either end (Renaissance) are not adjacent to any Baroque artwork.", "Thus, the second baroque painting must be in room 3 (between two Modernism pieces) and the Modernism piece next to it is Renaissance.", "So we have: \n1st Room: Modernism\n2nd Room: Baroque\n3rd Room: Renaissance\n4th Room: Baroque\n5th Room: Renaissance\n\n\nGiven that there are no other options left, we can conclude that the 2nd room must also be Baroque as it's the only one available.", "So final arrangement is:\n1st Room: Modernism\n2nd Room: Baroque\n3rd Room: Renaissance\n4th Room: Baroque\n5th Room: Renaissance\n\nAnswer: The style and position of
