{"raw_text": "Scotland v Italy (Sat)\n \n Murrayfield, Edinburgh\n \n Saturday, 26 February\n \n 1400 GMT\n \n BBC1, Five Live and this website\n \n Victory for the Azzurri in Rome last year saw Scotland end their campaign without a victory. And the pressure is on Scotland coach Matt Williams as he seeks a first Six Nations victory at the eighth attempt. Italy have lost both their opening games at home to Ireland and Wales, but travel to Edinburgh with high hopes.\n \n Their coach John Kirwan has warned his side they must eradicate the errors that blighted their loss to Wales however or risk suffering a third successive defeat. \"If the defeat against Wales has taught us anything, it's that at this level we can't make any mistakes,\" Kirwan said. \"In the Six Nations, every error you make will come at a high price. \"We have to be aggressive for 80 minutes, keep calm in every situation and display great maturity on the pitch.\n \n \"It will be fundamental to keep cool in the difficult moments - in the key situations of the game.\" Kirwan has recalled the experienced Cristian Stoica at centre and drafted in David dal Maso at open-side after star flanker Mauro Bergamasco was ruled out for the rest of the tournament. Scotland have also made two changes, Simon Webster replacing Simon Danielli on the wing and Simon Taylor returning for his first Test in a year, for injured flanker Jason White. Taylor's recovery from a serious knee injury is a major boost to Scottish hopes. \"He is one of the world-class players in the tournament and you want them in your team,\" acknowledged Williams.\n \n Despite a record of only two victories from 14 Tests, Williams insists he is revelling in the pressure. \"I actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach,\" he said, optimistic despite opening defeats to France and Ireland. \"We were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat Italy too,\" he added.\n \n : C Paterson; S Webster, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; S Taylor, J Petrie, A Hogg.\n \n R Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.\n \n R de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, C Stoica, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni; S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt); A Persico, D Dal Maso, S Parisse.\n \n G Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, S Orlando, P Griffen, R Pedrazzi, KP Robertson.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Scotland will travel to Italy seeking their first Six Nations victory at the eighth attempt.", "Coach Matt Williams is under pressure after last year's defeat in Rome.", "Italy coach John Kirwan has warned his team they must avoid mistakes if they want a win.", "He also recalled Cristian Stoica and made changes, including replacing Mauro Bergamasco with David dal Maso.", "Scotland coach Matt Williams is confident despite the pressure, saying he enjoys it as a coach and wants to beat Italy."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Scotland's coach Matt Williams seeks a first Six Nations victory at the eighth attempt as they face Italy at Murrayfield.", "Italy coach John Kirwan warns his team to eradicate errors made in their loss to Wales, while Scotland have made changes with new player Simon Taylor returning after a year-long injury."], "gemma2:2b": ["Scotland will face Italy in their Six Nations match on February 26th at Murrayfield.", "Scotland needs a victory to avoid another Six Nations winless campaign.", "Italy has struggled in their opening matches against Ireland and Wales but is hoping for a turnaround in Edinburgh.", "Scotland coach Matt Williams faces pressure with the team needing to break their recent losing streak.", "Both teams have made several changes, including Italy's call back of veteran center Cristian Stoica and Scotland's return of Simon Taylor."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Scotland defeated Italy in the Six Nations rugby tournament on Saturday night, and Scotland coach Matt Williams is confident his team will have a chance of winning the game.", "The Scots have only lost two out of their 14 games played this season at the Six Nations, but there are still some big games to come against France and Ireland.", "Williams insists they have a strong team in their ranks, with experienced players like Cristian Stoica on the wing, David Dal Maso in open-side play, Jason White injured for the tournament, Simon Webster returning from injury, Simon Taylor being his first Test since a year ago, and Simon Danielli taking the side to the semi-finals."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Scotland vs Italy: 2017 Six Nations match preview.", "Williams aims for first win in eight tries.", "Italy coach warns of crucial errors needed to avoid third consecutive defeat, targeting experienced Cristian Stoica and David dal Maso replacements.", "Scotland's changes include Simon Webster at wing and Simon Taylor returning after injury; Williams relishes pressure while opening loss to France and Ireland prompts confidence.", "Scottie, Smith, Grimes, Murray lineups detailed.", "Italy lineup also provided."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Scotland face Italy at Murrayfield in Edinburgh on Saturday, February 26th at 14:00 GMT.", "BBC1, Five Live and this website will broadcast the match.", "Scotland last won a Six Nations game eight attempts ago.", "Coach Matt Williams seeks his first victory despite opening losses to France and Ireland.", "Italian coach John Kirwan is urging caution after their narrow loss to Wales.", "Italy recall experience at center Cristian Stoica and draft in David dal Maso.", "Scottish team includes Simon Webster, Simon Taylor, and Jason White's replacement, S.
