{"raw_text": "Hansen 'delays return until 2006'\n \n British triple jumper Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury, according to reports.\n \n Hansen, the Commonwealth and European champion, has been sidelined since the European Cup in Poland in June 2004. It was hoped she would be able to return this summer, but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal. Her coach Aston Moore told the Times: \"We're not looking at any sooner than 2006, not as a triple jumper.\" Moore said Hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner, but there is no short-term prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event. \"There was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months, but that has been solved and we can push ahead now,\" he said. \"The aim is for her to get fit as an athlete - then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena.\" Moore said he is confident Hansen can make it back to top-level competition, though it is unclear if that will be in time for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next March, when she will be 34. \"It's been a frustrating time for her, but it has not fazed her determination,\" he added.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Ashia Hansen rules out comeback due to slow recovery from knee injury.", "She has been sidelined since June 2004 and coach Aston Moore says there is no prospect of her returning this year or next summer.", "Hansen may return to sprinting and long jumping, but not as a triple jumper."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback as a triple jumper this year due to a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury.", "Her coach expects a possible return in 2006."], "gemma2:2b": ["Ashia Hansen's comeback as a triple jumper is delayed until 2006 due to a slow-healing knee injury.", "Her coach says she may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping earlier.", "While her focus is on regaining fitness, the possibility of competing at top level remains uncertain, especially considering the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Melbourne."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["British triple jumper Ashia Hansen has reportedly delayed returning to competitive jumping until 2006 due to ongoing recovery from a knee injury.", "Moore, head coach of the British triple jump team, stated that she expects Hansen to make a comeback in the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next March, with her primary focus being sprinting and long jump events.", "Moore emphasized that while Hansen has shown progress through rehabilitation, there is no immediate short-term prospect of her returning to competitive levels."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Triple jumper Ashia Hansen ruled out of this year's comeback due to slow healing from knee injury, aiming for 2006 return;
