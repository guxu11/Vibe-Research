{"raw_text": "Dibaba breaks 5,000m world record\n \n Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba set a new world record in winning the women's 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games.\n \n Dibaba won in 14 minutes 32.93 seconds to erase the previous world indoor mark of 14:39.29 set by another Ethiopian, Berhane Adera, in Stuttgart last year. But compatriot Kenenisa Bekele's record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men's 3,000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon. Ireland's Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.89 as Bekele battled to second in 7:41.42. \"I didn't want to sit back and get out-kicked,\" said Cragg. \"So I kept on the pace. The plan was to go with 500m to go no matter what, but when Bekele made the mistake that was it. The race was mine.\" Sweden's Carolina Kluft, the Olympic heptathlon champion, and Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak had winning performances, too. Kluft took the long jump at 6.63m, while Ceplak easily won the women's 800m in 2:01.52.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Tirunesh Dibaba set a new world record for the women's 5,000m with a time of 14:32.93 seconds at the Boston Indoor Games.", "Berhane Adera of Ethiopia previously held the previous indoor mark, but Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia was eliminated from contention after miscounting his laps and staging a sprint finish too early."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia set a new world record in the women's 5,000m with a time of 14 minutes 32.93 seconds at the Boston Indoor Games.", "Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia was second with 7:41.42 after miscounting his laps and sprinting too early.", "Ireland's Alistair Cragg won the men's 3,000m in 7:39.89.", "Carolina Kluft of Sweden won the long jump with a mark of 6.63m, while Jolanda Ceplak of Slovenia won the women's 800m in 2:01.52."], "gemma2:2b": ["Tirunesh Dibaba set a new world record in the women's 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games, breaking the previous record set by Berhane Adera.", "Kenenisa Bekele had his record hopes dashed due to a laps miscount in the men's 3,000m, while Alistair Cragg won in the men's race with a time of 7:39.89.", "Carolina Kluft and Jolanda Ceplak also achieved victory in their respective events at the meet."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Dibaba broke the 5, 000 m world record in Boston Indoor Games.", "She finished in 14 minutes and 32.", "93 seconds ahead of Berhane Adera, who had set a new world indoor record earlier that year.", "Despite a mistake by her compatriot Kenenisa Bekele, Dibaba's victory over him ended his hopes of breaking the previous record.", "Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.", "89 as Dibaba battled to second place behind him."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Tirunesh Dibaba set a new world indoor record in the women's 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games with a time of 14:32:93, surpassing Berhane Adera's previous mark by nearly five seconds.", "Alistair Cragg secured second place in the men's 3,000m race after Kenenisa Bekele incorrectly counted laps and sprinted early.", "Dibaba overcame Bekele to win with a strong finish, while Ireland's Cragg finished as runner-up in a time of 7:39:89."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia set a new world record in the women's 5,000m with a time of 14:32.93 at the Boston Indoor Games, eclipsing Berhane Adera\u2019s previous mark by nearly 7 seconds.", "Kenenisa Bekele from Ethiopia had his hopes dashed in the men's 3,000m as he miscounted his laps and sprinted too early, finishing second behind Ireland\u2019s Alistair Cragg who won with a time of 7:39.89.", "Other notable performances included Carolina Kluft winning the long jump at 6.63m in Sweden and Jolanda Ceplak clinching the women's 800m title in 2:01.52 from Slovenia."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Dibaba breaks a world record to win the women's 5,000m race against Ethiopia.", "She achieved a time of 14 minutes and 32.93 seconds to erase her previous record set by Berhane Adera in Stuttgart last year.", "The competition was also marked by Kenenisa Bekele, who staged his lap two minutes too early when miscounting the laps.", "Distinguished performances from the men's 3,000m race and Austria's Alistair Cragg were another crucial factor.", "Didding her up to the fast finish in Ireland's 7:39.89 seconds and Sweden's Carolina Kluft at a height of 6.63 meters was another significant achievement."], "smollm:1.7b": ["The summary is concise and to the point, capturing the main ideas and key details of the text.", "It does not provide any explanations or justifications for the events mentioned, but rather presents them as they are.", "The summary focuses on the outcome of the event, without providing context or background information about the athletes involved."], "deepseek-r1:1.5b": ["Dibaba from Ethiopia set a new women's 5,000m record at Boston Indoor Games with a world-best time of 14:32.93, surpassing last year's 14:39.29 mark.", "Crekka from Ireland also won in 7:39.89 and finished second to Dibaba.", "Kluft from Sweden and Ceplak from Slovenia secured their places with winning long jump and women's 800m, respectively."], "tinyllama:1.1b": ["DiBAba sets world record in women's 5,000m during Boston Indoor Games;
