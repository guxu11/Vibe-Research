Jake White claimed the coaching award while his side held off Grand Slam winners France to take the team award. England player Simon Amor beat team-mate Ben Gollings and Argentine Lucio Lopez Fleming to win the sevens award. Burger's award came just a week after he won the equivalent prize from his fellow international players and White, who also coached Burger at under-21 level, paid tribute to him. \"Schalk's emergence as a major force has meant a lot to South African rugby, but has also influenced world rugby,\" said White. \"He's become to South African rugby what Jonty Rhodes was to South African cricket. It's amazing what he has achieved in such a short time so far in his international career.\" Amor, who will captain England in this season's opening IRB Sevens tournament, the Dubai Sevens, which
