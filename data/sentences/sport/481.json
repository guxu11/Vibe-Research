{"raw_text": "Roddick splits from coach Gilbert\n \n Andy Roddick has ended an 18-month association with coach Brad Gilbert which yielded the US Open title and saw the American become world number one.\n \n Roddick released a statement through the SFX Sports Group with the news but did not give a reason for the split. \"The decision to not re-hire Brad Gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what I think is best for my game at this time,\" said Roddick. \"Any more on this situation's a private matter between coach and player.\" Roddick won 121 of his 147 matches while working with Gilbert, and said he had enjoyed their time together. He won his first Grand Slam event at Flushing Meadows last year, and finished 2003 on top of the ATP Tour rankings.\n \n But Roddick slipped to second this year behind Roger Federer, who became the first man since 1988 to win three Majors in a season. Federer, who has not had a coach since he split from Peter Lundgren at the end of last year, beat Roddick to win the Wimbledon title and in two other tournament finals. Roddick hired Gilbert after deciding to part from coach Tarik Benhabiles in the wake of his first-round exit at the 2003 French Open. He went on to win the US Open and four other titles for the year. He has won four events this season. \"I have enjoyed all of my time with Andy,\" Gilbert said on his personal website. \"He has been a great student of the game during the time that we worked together and I am very proud of the results that were achieved. \"While I believe that there is still a great deal of work to be done, Andy clearly does not feel that way.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Andy Roddick ends 18-month association with coach Brad Gilbert, who led him to two US Open titles and world number one status.", "Roddick released a statement without giving a reason for the split, but says it's best for his game at this time.", "He won 121 of his matches under Gilbert's guidance."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Andy Roddick splits from coach Brad Gilbert after 18 months, citing it's best for his game at this time, but didn't give reason for split.", "Roddick won 121 matches with Gilbert, including the US Open title, and enjoyed their time together.", "Federer surpassed Roddick to become world number one, winning three Majors in a season, and Gilbert said he's proud of the results achieved during their time together."], "gemma2:2b": ["Andy Roddick has ended his 18-month coaching relationship with Brad Gilbert, citing it's best for his game at this time.", "While they achieved success together including winning the US Open and becoming world number one, Roddick now believes a change is needed.", "Gilbert states he was proud of the results achieved during their time working together but acknowledges that Roddick disagrees."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Andy Roddick ended an 18-month association with his coach Brad Gilbert after deciding to move on, citing personal reasons in his statement.", "He won the US Open in 2003 and has finished in second place this season.", "While he enjoys their time together, he believes there is more work to be done for Andy Roddick's career."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Andy Roddick ends his 18-month coaching partnership with Brad Gilbert, who helped him win at Flushing Meadows and become world number one.", "Roddick enjoyed working with Gilbert but chose to move on after a successful season, slipping in rankings behind Roger Federer due to the latter's strong performance against him.", "Gilbert acknowledged their positive relationship but emphasized that Roddick did not feel as committed this year."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Roddick ends 18-month association with coach Brad Gilbert following US Open victory and becoming No.1.", "Both parties enjoyed working together;
