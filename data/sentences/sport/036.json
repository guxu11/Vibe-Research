{"raw_text": "Jones doping probe begins\n \n An investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones has been opened by the International Olympic Committee.\n \n IOC president Jacques Rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by Victor Conte, of Balco Laboratories. Jones, who says she is innocent, could lose all her Olympic medals after Conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the Sydney Olympics. But Rogge said it was too early to speculate about that, hoping only that \"the truth will emerge\".\n \n Any decision on the medals would be taken by the IOC's executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that Olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the Games closing. The Sydney Olympics ended more than four years ago, but World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now. \"We will find a way to deal with that,\" Pound said. In a statement released through her attorney Rich Nichols, Jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared. \"Victor Conte's allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward,\" she said. \"Conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory, inconsistent statements.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has opened an investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones, who denies all allegations.", "The IOC disciplinary body will examine Victor Conte's claims about Jones receiving performance-enhancing drugs before the 2000 Sydney Olympics.", "A decision on the medals could be made by the executive board after three years, but World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound suggests that the rule may not apply due to recent revelations."], "llama3.2:3b": ["An investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones has been opened by the International Olympic Committee after Victor Conte alleged that Jones received performance-enhancing drugs before the Sydney Olympics.", "Jones denies the allegations and vows to be cleared, while IOC president Jacques Rogge hopes that \"the truth will emerge\" without speculating on potential medal revocation."], "gemma2:2b": ["The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has initiated an investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones.", "Victor Conte alleges he provided her with performance-enhancing drugs before the 2000 Sydney Olympics.", "Jones denies any wrongdoing.", "The IOC's decision on whether to strip her of her medals could hinge on a rule limiting challenges to decisions made within three years of the Games."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["An investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones began by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) with the involvement of Victor Conte, Balco Laboratories' representative.", "Conte claimed he gave Jones performance-enhancing drugs before the Sydney Olympics.", "However, IOC president Jacques Rogge hopes that \"the truth will emerge\" and does not speculate about the outcome.", "The decision on medals would be made by the executive board and based on interpretation of a rule stating Olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years from the Games' end date, which ends more than four years after the Sydney Olympics.", "Dick Pound stated that the rule may not apply because the allegations are coming out now, while Rich Nichols reiterated Jones' claim of innocence.", "The attorney said Conte is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory statements."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["The International Olympic Committee investigates doping claims against Marion Jones, potentially leading to her losing all Olympic medals if true, with no concrete outcome expected until further investigation reveals the truth."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Jones doping probe begins;
