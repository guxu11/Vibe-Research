{"raw_text": "Capriati to miss Melbourne\n \n Jennifer Capriati has become the third leading lady to withdraw from the Australian Open because of injury.\n \n The organisers of the first grand slam of 2005, which begins on 17 January, said the American has a problem with her right shoulder. It comes as a blow to the women's draw as last year's champion, Justin Henin-Hardenne, and runner-up, Kim Clijsters, will also be absent. Capriati is a two-time champion in Melbourne with wins in 2001 and 2002. She is believed to have picked up the injury at the Advanta Championships at Philadelphia in November and had to pull out of an exhibition match with Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova on 17 December. Capriati also decided against competing in the Australian Open warm-up event, the Sydney International.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Jennifer Capriati has withdrawn from the Australian Open due to injury, which affects her right shoulder.", "She is the third leading lady to do so this year."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Jennifer Capriati withdraws from the Australian Open due to a right shoulder injury, joining Justin Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters as absentees."], "gemma2:2b": ["Jennifer Capriati withdrew from the Australian Open due to a right shoulder injury.", "She joins Henin-Hardenne and Clijsters as absences from the tournament, which begins January 17th.", "This is significant for the women's draw as Capriati has won the tournament twice previously."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Jennifer Capriati withdrew from the Australian Open because of injury during the first Grand Slam tennis tournament in Melbourne.", "She was injured at Advanta Championships in November and had to withdraw from exhibition matches with Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova on December 17th.", "Her decision against competing in the Sydney International also affected her chances for a warm-up event in Melbourne."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Australian Open women's draw postponed due to Jennifer Capriati's injury withdrawal; previously held champions injured at previous Grand Slam and tournament qualification cancelled."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Jennifer Capriati has withdrawn from the 2005 Australian Open due to a right shoulder injury.", "She is one of three top players missing the tournament, joining last year's champion Justin Henin-Hardenne and runner-up Kim Clijsters.", "A two-time winner in Melbourne (2001, 2002), Capriati pulled out after her injury likely arose from Nov. 2004 at the Advanta Championships and an exhibition match against Maria Sharapova on December 17th.", "She also chose not to compete in the Australian Open warm-up event, the Sydney International."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["\"Capriati's decline from the Australian Open reflects a change in priorities, including injury and preference for certain performances.\""], "smollm:1.7b": ["Capriati to miss Melbourne"], "deepseek-r1:1.5b": ["Jennifer Capriati has withdrawn from the Australian Open due to injury, marking her third withdrawal since last year.", "The organizers stated she had a problem with her right shoulder, affecting Justin Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters.", "She competed at the Advanta Championships in November but withdrew from Sharapova's exhibition match on Dec 17.", "Capriati avoided the Sydney International warm-up event."], "tinyllama:1.1b": ["Jennifer Capriaati has withdrawn from the Australian Open due to injury, leaving a third leading lady absent.", "The organisers have confirmed that the American has a problem with her right shoulder and has been forced out of both the Australian Open and Sydney International warm-up event.", "This leaves two more players competing in the women's draw, and Capriaati's absence is believed to be due to an injury picked up at the Philadelphia Championships in November.", "As one of the top players from 2005, Capriaati was expected to contend for major titles in Melbourne, but her withdrawal will leave a gaping hole in the women's draw."], "tinydolphin:1.1b": [" Jennifer Capriati has been forced to withdraw from the Australian Open tennis tournament due to injury.", "The prominent American tennis player has been dealing with a problem on her right shoulder and had initially hoped to participate in the event, which begins on January 17th.", "However, she will now have to miss out on what would have been her third consecutive appearance at the championship.", "As a result, two of the three top contenders for the title in 2005 -
