But, in the wider picture, what message does this send out?\" He thought the work of Scotland's coaches, who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side, would be made much more difficult. \"Matt Williams and Willie Anderson must be wondering, 'what have we walked into here?'\" said Calder. \"And we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the Six Nations Championship. \"I am very, very disappointed, more than you can imagine. Why do so many Scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough?\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Calder fears Scottish rugby's professional football league could be damaged by a civil
