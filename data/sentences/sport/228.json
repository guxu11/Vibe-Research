But Houllier told BBC Sport: \"In private and in public, I have stressed I believe Rafa is doing a good job. He is the right man at the right place. \"Rafa is a good coach and a good man. I've spoken to him since he has been at Liverpool and never criticised him.\" Houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving Liverpool in May following six years at Anfield.\n \n The former France boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed Mark Hughes as Wales national coach. He has been working for Uefa, covering the Premiership for French television and also coaching in Brazil with national coach Carlos Alberto Perreira. Houllier said: \"If a good club comes up at the right time then yes, I am ready to come back. \"It has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and I have learned things. \"I have been involved in football since leaving Liverpool and my batteries are recharged.\"\n \n Houllier has been impressed with the quality in the Premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with Jose Mourinho's work at leaders Chelsea.
