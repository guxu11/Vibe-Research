{"raw_text": "Soderling wins tense Milan final\n \n Fifth seed Robin Soderling took the Milan Indoors title with a dramatic win over Radek Stepanek in Sunday's final.\n \n The 20-year-old Swede edged the final set tie-break for a 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) victory and his second tour title after winning in Lyon last year. \"I'm delighted to have won against such a good opponent in a tournament of this importance,\" said Soderling. \"I was really on form, my service was good and I really liked playing on the synthetic surface.\" Soderling, the world number 37, shrugged off a nervous start to take the opening set on his first set point. A change in approach from fourth seed Stepanek in the second set paid dividends as he took it on a tie-break, but Soderling's superior power proved too much in the third.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Robin Soderling wins Milan final against Radek Stepanek."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Robin Soderling won the Milan Indoors title with a 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) victory over Radek Stepanek in the final, his second tour title after winning in Lyon last year."], "gemma2:2b": ["Robin Soderling won the Milan Indoors title by defeating Radek Stepanek in a tense final.", "Soderling overcame a nervous start to win the final set 7-6 (7-5), securing his second tour title after winning in Lyon last year."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Swede wins Milan title after edge over Radek Stepanek - 20-year-old Swede edged the final set tie-break for victory."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Swedish fifth seed Robin Soderling won the Milan Indoors title against Radek Stepanek with a 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) victory, earning his second tour title after last year's Lyon win."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Fifth-seeded Robin Soderling claimed the Milan Indoors title with a nerve-wracking 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) victory over Radek Stepanek.", "The 20-year-old Swede, ranked world No.", "37, triumphed in his second tournament of the year following his win in Lyon last year.", "Soderling praised his form and served well on the synthetic surface, securing the opening set on his first match point despite a sluggish start.", "In the second set, Stepanek switched tactics but was unable to counter Soderling's powerful play in the third set, leading to a decisive victory."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Soderling wins the Milan final with Radek Stepanek winning over his first match.", "He has won more matches than any other player and is known for his exceptional defensive capabilities."], "smollm:1.7b": ["Soderling won the 2019 Indoors title at Milan with a 6-3 win over Radek Stepanek in the second set."], "deepseek-r1:1.5b": ["Robin Soderling secured the Milan Indoors final victory by defeating Radek Stepanek in a thrilling 6-3 6-7 (2-7) and 7-5 7-6 (7-5) game.", "Known for his consistency, Soderling was on form with a strong service and appreciated facing such a formidable opponent.", "The victory brought him to World Tour qualification from the fifth seed position."], "tinyllama:1.1b": ["The fifth seed Robin Soderling won the Milan Indoor title after defeating Radek Stepanek in a dramatic final set tiebreaker on Sunday.", "The 20-year-old Swede edged out his French opponent in a tight final set and claimed his second ATP Tour title, beating Stepanek 6-3, 7-6(5) for the trophy.", "Sooderling was a formidable opponent throughout, with his game featuring high-quality serving and power shots.", "His win marked his fourth career tournament victory on the ATP Tour, following in the footsteps of his previous wins in Lyon last year.", "The match was a closely contested affair that saw both players make critical errors at the start, but Sooderling's superior power proved too much to overcome."], "tinydolphin:1.1b": [" Soderling wins tense Milan final, advancing to ATP Finals for first time;
