{"raw_text": "Sculthorpe wants Lions captaincy\n \n Paul Sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain skipper if the Wigan star does switch codes to rugby union.\n \n Sculthorpe was vice-captain in the Tri-Nations, and took the St Helens captaincy from Chris Joynt last year. \"I would definitely want the job - I make no bones about it,\" Sculthorpe told BBC Sport. \"It's something I've always wanted to do. I'd gladly take it if it was offered to me.\"\n \n The 27-year-old, who captained St Helens to Challenge Cup success last year, said following in the footsteps of Farrell would be a challenge. \"Andy would be a hard act to follow but it's something I'm confident of being up to,\" he said. \"The GB team isn't a one-man team. There are a lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway.\"\n \n Sculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if Farrell did decide to move to rugby union. \"It's a short career and you have to make of it what you can,\" said Sculthorpe. \"Nobody can blame him if he does go - he's done everything in the game of rugby league.\n \n \"Financially it could set him up for life. If he fancies a new challenge, then who could fault him?\" Sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play. Sean Long, Sculthorpe's Saints and Lions team-mate, has expressed doubts about his international future \"I think Sean's situation is to do with the sheer number of games we're playing,\" he said.\n \n \"The way he's looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby, then he's willing to do that. \"The RFL has got to do something about the fixtures. We're playing 42 weeks of the year and it's too much. \"A lot of the niggly injuries that I've suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time.\" St Helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward Sonny Bill Williams, and Sculthorpe said he would love the 19-year-old to come to Knowsley Road. \"He's a great player - a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence, but who is also very skilful,\" he said. \"I'd love him to come to St Helens. Who knows what might happen? But you want the best players in your team, and he's certainly one of the best players in the world.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Paul Sculthorpe has expressed interest in succeeding Andy Farrell as Great Britain rugby union captain if Farrell leaves Wigan for rugby union.", "Sculthorpe has already captained St Helens to Challenge Cup success and was vice-captain in the Tri Nations.", "He believes that following Farrell into rugby union would be a challenge but is confident he can handle it."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Paul Sculthorpe wants to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain rugby union captain if he switches codes from rugby league.", "Sculthorpe previously captained St Helens and expressed confidence in taking on the role.", "He also called for a review of top players' game schedules, citing the impact of playing 42 weeks a year, and linked St Helens to signing Sonny Bill Williams."], "gemma2:2b": ["Paul Sculthorpe expresses interest in becoming Great Britain captain if Andy Farrell moves to rugby union.", "He believes it would be a challenge but is confident in his ability to lead the team.", "Sculthorpe acknowledges Farrell's right to pursue opportunities in other sports and suggests that the rugby league authorities should address excessive fixture load for top players, citing injuries as a consequence.", "He also expresses enthusiasm about Sonny Bill Williams potentially joining St Helens."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Paul Sculthorpe wants to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain skipper if Andy leaves rugby union, but not for his own reasons.", "Sculthorpe also thinks it would be a good move for the GB team since there are other young players pushing for places and the number of games they play is too many.", "He believes the RFL should have more games played each year so they can balance the game better."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Paul Sculthorpe expresses interest in becoming Great Britain rugby league captain if Andy Farrell switches codes, citing confidence in his ability to follow in the footsteps of current skipper.", "Sculthorpe believes there should be a change in the number of games top players are expected to play and calls for the Rugby League International Federation (RFL) to consider reducing fixtures to avoid overexertion of athletes."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Paul Sculthorpe expresses interest in succeeding Andy Farrell as Great Britain captain if Farrell switches codes to rugby union.", "Sculthorpe admires Farrell but believes his position will be filled by other talented young players.", "He suggests Farrell\u2019s decision is understandable given a short career and potential financial benefits from moving to rugby union.", "Sculthorpe also criticizes the number of games top players are required to play in rugby league, calling for changes from governing bodies.", "He supports St Helens potentially signing Sonny Bill Williams, describing him as an excellent player with both strength and skill."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Sculthorpe wants Lions captaincy\n\nPaul Sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain skipper if the Wigan star does switch codes to rugby union.", "The 27-year-old, who captained St Helens to Challenge Cup success last year, said following in the footsteps of Farrell would be a challenge.", "\"Andy would be a hard act to follow but it's something I'm confident of being up to,\" he said.", "The GB team isn't a one-man team;
