{"raw_text": "Kenyon denies Robben Barca return\n \n Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has played down reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona.\n \n \"He's been responding well to treatment and started running on Friday, but we'll have to wait and see,\" he told BBC Five Live's Sportsweek. \"We're looking to getting him back as soon as possible, but he'll be back when it's right for him and for us. \"There's no plans at the moment around the Barcelona game.\" His comments contradict those of chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who treated the Dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of February. Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago. It was an obvious correction and easy to perform. \"I know he was pleased with what I did and now that he is running again. I am due to see him one more time again in the next few days.\" Meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at Italian side AC Milan.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has denied reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona, citing treatment and rehabilitation progress but delaying his return until he is \"back when it's right for him and for us.\""], "llama3.2:3b": ["Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has denied reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona, contradicting comments from Robben's chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who suggested he could be fit in time for the game on March 8."], "gemma2:2b": ["Kenyon says Arjen Robben will not be playing in the Champions League match against Barcelona.", "Robben's chiropractor believes he could return, but Kenyon says there are no plans for his return yet."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has denied Robben Barca's return for a Champions League match against Barcelona.", "He expressed hope that the injury was fixed, but noted he will wait to see if it is good enough for him and his team.", "Kenyon does not provide details about when he expects Robben to be back."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Chelsea denies Arjen Robben's return for Champions League match against Barcelona, stating he will be back only when right for both club and individual.", "Chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman supports Robben's fitness to play but expects recovery time of six weeks due to a January foot fracture."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Peter Kenyon, Chelsea's executive, denies reports of Arjen Robben returning for the Champions League match against Barcelona, stating they are waiting until it\u2019s right for Robben and Chelsea.", "This contradicts chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who earlier suggested Robben might be fit in time for the game on 3 March.", "Meersseman had previously stated he corrected Robben's foot in February allowing for a quicker recovery."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Kenyon denies Robben Barca return\n\nChelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has played down reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona.", "He's been responding well to treatment and started running on Friday, but we'll have to wait and see.", "He told BBC Five Live's Sportsweek: \"We're looking to getting him back as soon as possible, but he'll be back when it's right for him and for us.\"", "There's no plans at moment around the Barcelona game.", "His comments contradict those of chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who treated the Dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of February.", "Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March.", "\"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen.\"", "Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday: \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.", "It was an obvious correction and easy to perform.\"", "Meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at Italian side AC Milan."], "smollm:1.7b": ["The summary should be: Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has denied Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona, and there are no plans to get him back as soon as possible.", "There have been reports that Arjen Robben is expected to be out for six weeks, but it's unclear if he can be fit for Stamford Bridge on 8 March.", "The summary should preserve key ideas and details: Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has denied Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona;
