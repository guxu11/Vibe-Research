{"raw_text": "Clijsters hope on Aussie Open\n \n Kim Clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of January's Australian Open because of her persistent wrist injury.\n \n Open chief Paul McNamee had said: \"Kim's wrist obviously isn't going to be rehabilitated.\" But her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry. \"The doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. But if there's the least risk she will stay away.\" Despite being absent from the WTA entry list for the tournament, which begins on 17 January, Clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. Clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. The Belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. Meanwhile, Jelena Dokic, who used to compete for Australia, has opted out of the first Grand Slam of the season. Dokic has not played in the Australian Open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. But the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. Four-time champion Monica Seles, who has not played since last year's French Open, is another absentee because of an injured left foot.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Kim Clijsters denied reports she'd leave Australian Open due to wrist injury.", "Her spokesman said she might stay away but would reassess weekly."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Kim Clijsters denies reports she pulled out of the Australian Open due to a persistent wrist injury, stating she delayed submitting her entry for assessment by doctors on a weekly basis."], "gemma2:2b": ["Kim Clijsters will likely miss the Australian Open due to her wrist injury, which was assessed weekly by doctors.", "Jelena Dokic and Monica Seles are also absent from the tournament due to injuries (Dokic's ranking has dropped significantly) or last season's form, respectively.", "Clijsters' absence would likely be filled with a wild card entry if she chooses to play."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Clijsters hopes the Australian Open will be her wildcard for the WTA tournament she had been declining to play due to a wrist injury.", "She can still compete in the first Grand Slam season (Australian Open), where she has not played since 2001 and is ranked 127th overall."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters withdrew from January's Australian Open after reported wrist injury;
