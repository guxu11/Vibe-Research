{"raw_text": "Sony wares win innovation award\n \n Sony has taken the prize for top innovator at the annual awards of PC Pro Magazine.\n \n It won the award for taking risks with products and for its \"brave\" commitment to good design. Conferring the award, PC Pro's staff picked out Sony's PCG-X505/P Vaio laptop as a \"stunning piece of engineering\". The electronics giant beat off strong competition from Toshiba and chip makers AMD and Intel to take the gong.\n \n Paul Trotter, news and features editor of PC Pro, said several Sony products helped it to take the innovation award.\n \n He said Sony's Clie PEG UX50 media player with its swivel screen and qwerty keyboard \"broke the design rules yet again\". Other Sony products that helped included the Vaio W1 desktop computer and the RA-104 media server. Mr Trotter said Sony's combining of computer, screen and keyboard in the W1 was likely to be widely copied in future home PCs. The company has also become one of the first to use organic LEDs in its products. \"While not always inventing new technology itself, Sony was never afraid to innovate around various formats,\" said Mr Trotter.\n \n Other awards decided by PC Pro's staff and contributors included one for Canon's EOS 300D digital camera in the Most Wanted Hardware category.\n \n Microsoft's Media Player 10 took the award for Most Wanted Software.
