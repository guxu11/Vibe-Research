{"raw_text": "Mobile gig aims to rock 3G\n \n Forget about going to a crowded bar to enjoy a gig by the latest darlings of the music press.\n \n Now you could also be at a live gig on your mobile, via the latest third generation (3G) video phones. Rock outfit Rooster are playing what has been billed as the first ever concert broadcast by phone on Tuesday evening from a London venue. The 45-minute gig is due to be \"phone cast\" by the 3G mobile phone operator, 3. 3G technology lets people take, watch and send video clips on their phones, as well as swap data much faster than with 2G networks like GSM. People with 3G phones in the UK can already download football and music clips on their handsets.\n \n Some 1,000 fans of the London-based band will have to pay five pounds for a ticket and need a 3G handset.\n \n \"Once you have paid, you can come and go as much as you like, because we expect the customers to be mobile,\" said 3 spokesperson Belinda Henderson. \"It's like going to a concert hall, except that you are virtually there.\" The company behind the trial hopes to learn more about how people use their video phones. \"We are looking on how long people will stay on average on the streams. Some people may stay the whole time, some may dip in and out,\" said Ms Henderson. \"We actually expect people to dip in and out because they are mobile and they will be doing other things.\" 3 is looking to music as a way of persuading more people to take up the latest video phones. It is already planning regular gigs throughout 2005. And during the intermission, of course, you would still be able to make a phone call.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Rooster's concert broadcast via mobile 3G video phones will be available for 45 minutes on Tuesday evening from a London venue.", "The live gig is part of a trial with 1,000 fans who must pay \u00a35 per ticket and have a 3G handset.", "The concert hall-like experience allows users to watch and send video clips while being mobile, with the company hoping to learn how long people stay on average streams."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Rooster rock gig will be broadcast via 3G mobile phones in London with 1,000 fans paying \u00a35 for ticket access.", "The 45-minute concert will let viewers come and go as they please, with the goal of understanding how people use their video phones during the event."], "gemma2:2b": ["A live music gig by the band Rooster will be broadcast via 3G mobile phone technology for the first time, with audience members paying \u00a35 and attending virtually in their homes.", "The trial aims to gather data about how people use video phones and further encourage adoption of these devices through planned regular gigs throughout 2005."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["1.", "Mobile gig aims to rock 3G\n\n  2.", "London-based band Rooster performs live by phone with latest third-generation (3G) video phones.", "3.", "Some 1,000 fans have to pay five pounds for tickets and need 3G devices to watch the concert.", "4.", "The company behind the trial hopes to learn more about how people use their video phones.", "5.", "3 is looking to persuade more people to take up 3G by offering regular gigs throughout 2005."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Rooster's mobile gig on 3G technology will broadcast a 45-minute concert from London for 1, 000 paying customers who need a 3G handset.", "Users can watch and send video clips via their phones, exchanging data faster than with GSM networks.", "The company hopes to study customer behavior while using 3G devices, which it plans to expand into regular concerts in 2005."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Mobile gig aims to rock 3G.", "Rooster's live concert from London will be broadcast via 3G mobile phones for \u00a35 entry fee.", "The 45-minute show uses 3G technology allowing users to watch and send video clips, faster than on 2G networks.", "Around 1,000 fans with compatible 3G handsets can attend;
