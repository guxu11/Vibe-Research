{"raw_text": "Telewest to challenge Sky Plus\n \n Cable firm Telewest is to offer a personal video recorder (PVR) in a set -top box to challenge Sky Plus.\n \n Sky Plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the UK, with 474,000 subscribers. PVRs record TV programmes to a hard drive, letting viewers pause, and rewind live television and effectively \"time shift\" the viewing experience. A number of PVRs incorporating Freeview digital terrestrial TV are also on the market but their success is limited. Telewest's PVR will offer a 160GB hard drive, which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes. The box has three tuners, which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching a third channel.\n \n Sky Plus boxes come in two versions - a 20GB version for \u00a399 and a 160GB version for \u00a3399. Sky also charges a \u00a310 subscription fee to the service, unless viewers have a subscription to one of its premium packages. Telewest has yet to reveal pricing for the new box or if it will be charging a subscription fee for the service.\n \n Eric Tveter, president and chief operating officer at Telewest Broadband, said: \"We will make our PVR set-top box available later this year, putting a stop to missed soaps, interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record.\" PVRs and recordable DVD players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite TV programmes. Last year, high street retailer Dixons said it was going to stop selling VHS machines in favour of PVRs and recordable DVD machines. Sky has said it aims to have 25% of its subscribers using Sky Plus by 2010 - it is predicting 10 million total subscribers by that date. It currently has 7.4 million subscribers, while Telewest provides digital cable to 1.7 million customers.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Telewest will offer a personal video recorder (PVR) in a set-top box to challenge Sky Plus's market leader status.", "The PVR will record TV programs up to 80 hours and allow viewers to pause, rewind live TV, and \"time shift\" the viewing experience.", "It will have three tuners for simultaneous recording."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Telewest will offer a personal video recorder (PVR) in a set-top box later this year, challenging Sky Plus's market leadership with features including a 160GB hard drive and three tuners for simultaneous recording of multiple channels.", "The PVR service is expected to be priced similarly to the 160GB version of Sky Plus, but pricing has not been confirmed."], "gemma2:2b": ["Telewest will release a PVR set-top box to compete with Sky Plus.", "The box offers 160GB storage and allows recording of two channels simultaneously while watching a third.", "Telewest has not yet revealed pricing or subscription fees, but expects the PVR to become the standard for TV recording."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Telewest plans to offer a PVR set-top box to compete with Sky Plus in the UK market, offering 160GB storage capacity and three tuners for simultaneous recording of two channels while watching third.", "Eric Tveter of Telewest Broadband says this will be available later this year, ending \"missed soaps,\" \"interrupted films\" and TV-watching arguments over which programmes to record.", "Sky Plus has previously stated it plans to offer subscription-based services in the UK, with plans to have 25% of its subscribers using Sky Plus by 2010.", "Telewest will also provide digital cable services, but is not specifying pricing or subscription fees for the PVR box."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Telewest plans to offer a personal video recorder (PVR) set-top box in the UK market, challenging Sky Plus, which is leading in digital video recorders with over 474,000 subscribers.", "The new PVR has a 160GB hard drive and three tuners for simultaneous channel recording.", "It competes against other Freeview-based PVRs but won't release pricing or subscription plans yet.", "Sky Plus offers a basic 20GB version and premium packages at \u00a310 per month, aiming to have 10 million subscribers by 2010."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Telewest plans to introduce a PVR set-top box with a 160GB hard drive and three tuners to challenge Sky Plus, the UK's leading digital video recorder service with 474,000 subscribers.", "Telewest's offering is expected to debut later this year, aimed at addressing missed TV shows and interruptions.", "Prices are yet to be revealed, unlike Sky Plus which starts from \u00a399 for a 20GB version up to \u00a3399 for the 160GB option plus an additional \u00a310 subscription fee.", "PVRs are predicted to replace traditional video recorders as standard recording devices."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Telewest, offering a personal video recorder set-top box for Sky Plus, challenges the market leader in UK digital video recorders with a 160GB hard drive and three tuners that enables simultaneous recording of two channels.", "The firm's PVR will offer a 20GB version at \u00a399 and a 160GB version at \u00a3399.", "It also charges a subscription fee of \u00a310 for premium packages, unlike the Freeview digital terrestrial TV included on the market but limited.", "With SkyPlus, Eric Tveter was said to be in the business of making the PVR set-top box available later this year.", "The new box and its availability are expected to replace VHS recorders as standard methods of recording and saving favourite TV programmes.", "Dixons' high-street retailer, which had previously sold VHS tapes, is now seeing signs of increasing sales with its replacement recordable systems."], "smollm:1.7b": ["Telewest will offer a personal video recorder (PVR) in a set-top box to challenge Sky Plus.", "The new PVR will record TV programmes to a hard drive and allow viewers to pause, rewind live television and effectively \"time shift\" the viewing experience.", "A number of PVRs incorporating Freeview digital terrestrial TV are also on the market but their success is limited.", "Telewest's PVR will offer a 160GB hard drive, which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes.", "The box has three tuners, which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching a third channel.", "Sky Plus boxes come in two versions -
