{"raw_text": "Blair backs 'pre-election budget'\n \n Tony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.\n \n In a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.\n \n He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"No politician should make the mistake that John Major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.\n \n \"That is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do.\" Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were \"affordable\" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the \"cornerstone\" of Labour's programme.\n \n In a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months \"a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term\".\n \n \"In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,\" Mr Blair said. In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: \"He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK. We're not so sure.\" David Page, of Investec Securities, said: \"His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of \u00a38bn is way too optimistic. \"It's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.\"\n \n Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"I can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. \"In order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election.\" Mr Letwin accused the chancellor of using \"fancy statistics\" to hide public service failures. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his \"golden rule\". \"It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,\" Mr Cable told MPs.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Tony Blair backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report, saying it reinforced stability and opportunity for the UK economy.", "The report was seen as central to Labour's next election campaign.", "Brown denied his forecasts were too optimistic, but refused to rule out future tax rises.", "He stated that politicians should be cautious in making guarantees and that economic stability is a cornerstone of Labour's programme."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Tony Blair backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report, praising stability and opportunity as central to Labour's next election campaign.", "Brown said forecasts were affordable but refused to rule out tax rises.", "Critics argue his economic forecasts are too optimistic and that he is using \"fancy statistics\" to hide public service failures."], "gemma2:2b": ["Tony Blair supports Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report, which predicts 3% to 3.5% UK growth.", "Critics argue the forecast is too optimistic and may lead to tax increases or cuts.", "Blair emphasizes the importance of economic stability for Labour's future policy agenda.", "Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin criticizes the chancellor's overestimated financial forecasts and calls for increased taxes after the next election."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Tony Blair backs Gordon Brown\u2019s pre-Budget report and says it reinforces stability and opportunity for Labour's next election campaign.", "He plans to publish a budget plan for the next three months, which includes details about the future economy.", "However, some City experts are worried that the Chancellor will meet his golden rule with a margin of \u00a38 billion.", "Oliver Letwin accuses Blair of using \"fancy statistics\" to hide public service failures and accuses Cable of calling on Brown to open up government books to look for signs of public spending problems."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Tony Blair backs Gordon Brown's pre-budget report after opposition claims it was too optimistic about the UK economy.", "The speech emphasized economic stability and affordability, and plans for a detailed future policy agenda focusing on opportunity, security, and stability.", "However, some City experts doubt the forecast of growth between 3% and 3.5%, citing overestimated tax receipts.", "Conservative Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin criticized Brown's use of \"fancy statistics\" to hide public service failures, while Liberal Democrat Vincent Cable called for opening government books to see if the \"golden rule\" has been met."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Tony Blair supported Chancellor Gordon Brown\u2019s pre-election budget report despite opposition claims about its overly optimistic economic forecasts.", "In a speech in Edinburgh, Blair praised Brown's role in creating economic stability as the cornerstone of Labour's programme and outlined plans for future policy across various sectors.", "However, some economists criticized Brown\u2019s growth predictions, suggesting they were too high and potentially requiring tax rises or spending cuts to meet fiscal targets.", "Conservative Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable both called for transparency regarding public finances, questioning the budget's reliability."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Blair backs 'pre-election budget' \n\nTony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.", "In a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity.", "And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced.", "Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic -
