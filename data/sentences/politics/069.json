{"raw_text": "Talks aim to avert pension strike\n \n Talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.\n \n Five public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain's biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.\n \n The five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the \"less painful\" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\"\n \n Unison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Public sector unions will hold private talks with the Deputy Prime Minister to discuss pension reform regulations that could lead to national strikes, including those affecting council workers and local government pension scheme changes.", "The talks aim to avoid confrontation before the general election."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Talks aimed at preventing national strikes over pension reforms will take place this weekend as five public sector unions meet with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to discuss withdrawing regulations on raising the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65.", "Up to 1.4m workers could participate in a strike already scheduled for March 23, but all sides aim to avoid a major confrontation ahead of the general election."], "gemma2:2b": ["Talks will take place this weekend between five public sector unions and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to discuss pension reforms and potential strikes.", "Unions are demanding the government withdraw proposed regulations raising the pension age, while the government insists on implementing the changes.", "The outcome of these talks could impact a potential strike by up to 1.4 million workers planned for March 23rd.", "Public sector unions have pledged their support for action if the government does not compromise."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["The public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead.", "They want the government to withdraw regulations raising the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65, which would have raised the pension age for local government workers by up to 1.4 million.", "The talks are ongoing and will take place over the next few days.", "Unison is holding a public ballot on strikes for up to 800,000 local government workers, including members of other unions.", "The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) leader Mark Serwotka warned that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.", "\"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years -
