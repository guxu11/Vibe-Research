{"raw_text": "Kennedy calls for Iraq exit plans\n \n Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq in the wake of next Sunday's elections in the country, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\n \n In a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of George W Bush, Mr Kennedy said Iraq had become a \"crucible of militant terrorism\". He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops \"as soon as the situation allows\", he said in London. Any exit strategy must \"augment and support\" the democratic process.\n \n \"There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,\" he said. \"There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.\" Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal \"regardless of the situation on the ground\".\n \n He accused Mr Blair's government of \"being less than straightforward\" over its plans. \"Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,\" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech. \"He should set out a proper exit strategy, including the phased withdrawal of British troops, as the security situation allows.\" Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - \"especially Islamic countries\".\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Kennedy calls for an Iraqi exit plan and says Tony Blair's government is \"less than straightforward\" over plans.", "He wants a phased withdrawal of UK troops as soon as the situation allows, augmenting the democratic process.", "There are concerns that British troops contribute to insurgency in Iraq.", "The Netherlands, Portugal, and Czech Republic will withdraw their troops regardless of the situation on the ground.", "Blair's government should set out an exit strategy, including a withdrawal plan, for next Sunday's elections."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Charles Kennedy calls for Tony Blair to set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq after next Sunday's elections, citing concerns about the insurgency and the potential role of coalition troops.", "He advocates for a phased withdrawal of UK troops as security allows, while also emphasizing the need to augment and support democratic processes in Iraq."], "gemma2:2b": ["Charles Kennedy calls for a phased withdrawal of UK troops from Iraq.", "He argues that the presence of British troops feeds the insurgency and that there needs to be a proper exit strategy, including the replacement of UK troops with forces from other countries."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy calls for a phased US withdrawal from Iraq and criticizes Blair's government.", "He wants Britain to set exit strategy with phased withdrawal of American troops, while calling on UK forces to replace them with other countries."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Charles Kennedy calls for Tony Blair to announce a proper exit plan from Iraq following elections.", "He suggests phased UK troop withdrawals and emphasizes the need to support democratic processes.", "Kennedy criticizes the government's lack of transparency on its exit strategy, suggesting it should include security situation assessments.", "He also proposes replacing British troops with forces from other countries, particularly Islamic nations."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Charles Kennedy calls for a phased UK troop withdrawal from Iraq following next Sunday's elections.", "He argues this should align with the democratic process and acknowledges some mistakes made by coalition forces.", "Kennedy criticizes the Blair government for not being transparent about its exit strategy, suggesting PM Tony Blair make a statement on Iraqi elections including a plan for UK troops to be withdrawn as circumstances permit.", "He advocates replacing British forces in Iraq with those from other countries, particularly Islamic nations."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Kennedy calls for an Iraq exit plan.", "Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy to combat next Sunday's elections.", "The strategy must augment and support the democratic process, as it aims to counter terrorism.", "British and American troops in Iraq have been part of the insurgency, raising concerns about their future.", "According to Mr Kennedy, those who agree that the mere presence of British and American forces in Iraq is a signal of an intense conflict are right on target.", "The Dutch military announced a possible withdrawal plan despite initial mistakes made -
