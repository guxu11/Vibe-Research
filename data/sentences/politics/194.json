{"raw_text": "Cherie accused of attacking Bush\n \n Cherie Blair has been accused of criticising George W Bush's policies in a private address she gave during a United States lecture tour.\n \n The prime minister's wife is said to have praised the Supreme Court for overruling the White House on the legal rights of Guantanamo Bay detainees. The Tories said she broke a convention that British political figures do not act in a partisan way when abroad. But Downing Street said she was speaking in her capacity as a lawyer. It said she was not expressing political opinions. Mrs Blair's remarks are said to have been made in a speech to law students in Massachusetts. She said the decision by the US Supreme Court to give legal protection to two Britons held at Guantanamo Bay was a significant victory for human rights and the international rule of law. She also described the US legal code as an outdated grandfather clock and welcomed a decision to throw out a law backed by Mr Bush relating to sodomy in Texas.\n \n BBC news correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said Mrs Blair was likely to face further calls for restraint, since the US election is imminent. \"There have been some objections from people reasonably close to the Bush administration about her making these comments in their backyard just two days before a presidential election,\" he said. \"Conservatives here too have made their feelings clear. \"Cherie Booth has always regarded herself as having an independent career. She has continued to practise as a major human rights lawyer in the courts. \"It's not unusual for her to make these sorts of criticisms clear but it can be embarrassing.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Cherie Blair was accused of criticizing George W Bush's policies during a lecture tour in the US, where she praised the Supreme Court for ruling on Guantanamo Bay detainees' legal rights and described the US legal code as outdated.", "Her comments were seen by some as partisan, prompting calls for restraint from the Bush administration and its supporters."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Cherie Blair accused of criticizing George W Bush's policies during a private address at a US lecture tour, praising the Supreme Court for its decision on Guantanamo Bay detainees and welcoming changes to Texas sodomy law."], "gemma2:2b": ["Cherie Blair faced criticism for criticizing George W Bush's policies during a lecture tour in the US, specifically praising the Supreme Court's decision regarding Guantanamo detainees and legal reform in Texas.", "The Tories accused her of violating convention by engaging in partisan behavior abroad.", "Downing Street defended her statements, stating they were made as a lawyer and not expressing political opinions."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Here is my summary of the text:\n\nCherie Blair, who criticized US President George W Bush on multiple occasions while attending a lecture tour in Massachusetts, was accused by some political opponents of speaking out of turn and criticising Bush's policies.", "Downing Street defended her remarks, saying she was speaking as a lawyer for the British government, not acting in a partisan manner when abroad.", "The UK Tories argued that Blair broke a convention that British politicians should be neutral during overseas visits, but many commentators believe this is overblown."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Prime Minister's wife Cherie Blair accused of privately criticizing US President George W.
