{"raw_text": "Abbas 'will not tolerate' attacks\n \n Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said he will not tolerate attacks such as last Friday's suicide bombing in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.\n \n In an interview ahead of a meeting in London to discuss Palestinian reforms, Mr Abbas said such attacks were against Palestinian interests. The Palestinian Authority (PA) was exerting \"a 100% effort\" to end the violence, Mr Abbas added. The attack, which killed five, was the first of its kind since he took office. Mr Abbas confirmed Israel shared information with the PA in the hunt for the organisers of the attack. The Israeli government refuses to accept Syria's denials that it was implicated in the nightclub bombing. Israeli officials gave an intelligence briefing to foreign ambassadors on Monday, explaining Syria's alleged involvement. British foreign minister Jack Straw said there had been a \"continuing stream\" of information suggesting Palestinian militant groups were operating from within Syria.\n \n In an email interview in the British newspaper the Independent, Mr Abbas said: \"We believe peace is possible now and we are ready to negotiate with Israel to reach a true and lasting peace based on justice and international legitimacy.\" He added: \"We have an opportunity and it would be irresponsible if we, the Israelis, or the world allow it to slip away.\" Tuesday's meeting on Palestinian reform is being hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Also due to attend are US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, World Bank officials and foreign ministers from 23 European and Arab countries. The conference was a \"vital step\" in renewing the peace process, Mr Straw said. \"It's a high-level attendance, which reflects the sense of momentum and opportunity created by recent events,\" he added. A spokesman for Mr Blair said the Prime Minister expected the conference to discuss \"a comprehensive, co-ordinated and, above all, practical work plan for both the Palestinian Authority and the international community\". Israel will not attend, but is said to be closely watching the outcome.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Mahmoud Abbas has stated that he will not tolerate attacks such as a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, where five were killed.", "The attack was linked to Syria, which Israel denies involvement.", "Abbas claims that Palestinian militant groups are operating from within Syria and believes peace is possible with Israel's support.", "A meeting on Palestinian reform is scheduled for London, attended by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, as well as foreign ministers and officials from 23 countries."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said he won't tolerate suicide bombings in Tel Aviv, calling them against Palestinian interests.", "He confirmed cooperation with Israel on finding attack organizers and expressed readiness to negotiate a lasting peace based on justice and international legitimacy."], "gemma2:2b": ["Abbas declares he won't tolerate attacks and aims for peace with Israel.", "Israel claims Syria is implicated in the Tel Aviv bombing.", "Mr Abbas confirms cooperation between PA and Israel.", "The London meeting on Palestinian reforms is a high-level gathering aimed at fostering peace."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Palestinian leader Abbas expressed his opposition to attacks such as the one in Tel Aviv, calling them \"against Palestinian interests.\"", "He confirmed that the PA had been exerting a 100% effort to end violence and emphasized that Israel shared information with PA about this.", "The Israeli government refused to accept Syrian allegations of involvement in the nightclub bombing.", "In an email interview to the Independent, Abbas stated that he believed a lasting peace could be achieved through negotiations and that peace would be more secure if it was reached with the support of both sides.", "The conference is being hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, with speakers including US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, World Bank officials, foreign ministers from 23 European and Arab countries, and Israel's prime minister."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Palestinian leader Abbas says he won't tolerate attacks like last Friday's suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, emphasizing efforts to end violence by PA.
