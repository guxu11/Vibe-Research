{"raw_text": "Blair returns from peace mission\n \n Prime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process.\n \n Mr Blair held talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. He confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the Palestinian Authority and address security issues would come at a London conference in March. Mr Blair also made a surprise trip to Iraq this week. The Israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah - the first world leader to do so. He nodded briefly towards the tomb, rather than lay a wreath, in what Palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.\n \n The BBC's Paul Reynolds says the London conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, who is expected to win the Palestinian presidential election on 9 January. At a news conference following talks with Mr Blair, Mr Abbas said the British prime minister was \"in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit\". He added: \"Your endeavour to hold a conference in London is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose.\" In an interview with the BBC's political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Blair said getting progress between Israelis and Palestinians would be \"tough, but at least we have got the first step\". Mr Blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the Israelis, but said the Israelis were entitled to expect Palestinians to give up terrorism. He argued that Mr Sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from Gaza had to be part of the peace process, not the end of it. Earlier, Mr Sharon again said he had not seen \"the slightest step\" the Palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged Palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. Before visiting Israel, Mr Blair made a surprise visit to Iraq, where he met leaders in Baghdad during his first trip to the city. He was briefed on preparations for the national poll, which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. He also flew to Basra in southern Iraq where British forces are stationed.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Here is a concise summary of the text:\n\nTony Blair has returned from his peace mission in the Middle East and attended talks with Israeli counterpart Ariel Sharon and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.", "Blair confirmed plans for a London conference in March to address security issues, which will shore up Abbas' leadership.", "The BBC reports that Abbas said Blair's efforts were \"in a unique position\" to help progress peaceful relations."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Tony Blair returns from Middle East peace mission, met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, announced plans for London conference in March to address security issues and reform the Palestinian Authority, made surprise visit to Iraq and visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat."], "gemma2:2b": ["Tony Blair returned from a Middle East peace mission and plans a London conference in March to reform the Palestinian Authority and address security issues.", "He met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, made a surprise trip to Iraq for meetings on the upcoming national election, and visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Prime Minister Tony Blair returns from his Middle East diplomatic mission and will attend a London conference to address peace efforts with Abbas.", "Blair says the meeting is an important step but acknowledges some Palestinians still want to see Israel withdraw from Gaza.", "Blair hopes the talks can help move forward peace negotiations, but acknowledges that achieving a lasting resolution remains a challenge."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Prime Minister Tony Blair returns from Middle East mission, meeting with Israeli leader and Palestinian president about peace talks and security issues, including holding a London conference on March 9th.", "Blair visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat without laying a wreath as agreed but did so in an attempt to compromise."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Blair returns from Middle East peace mission; held talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.", "London conference planned for March to support Palestinian Authority leadership, led by Abbas.", "Blair visited Yasser Arafat's tomb briefly without laying a wreath as an agreement.", "He praised the UK's role in supporting peace efforts.", "Also met with Iraqi leaders before his Iraq visit.", "Sharon expressed skepticism about Palestinians' progress towards ending terror attacks but acknowledged their election campaign could hinder."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Blair returns from peace mission\n\nPrime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process.", "Mr Blair held talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas.", "He confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the Palestinian Authority and address security issues would come at a London conference in March.", "Mr Blair also made a surprise trip to Iraq this week.", "The Israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend.", "Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah -
