{"raw_text": "Howard unveils election platform\n \n The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\n \n The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\n \n Campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\n \n In a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\n \n Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\n \n Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\n \n Labour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Howard unveils Conservative election platform focusing on restoring order, lowering taxes, and giving
