{"raw_text": "Kilroy names election seat target\n \n Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\n \n Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\n \n On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\n \n UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\n \n UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Robert Kilroy-Silk will contest Erewash constituency at the next general election after announcing his new party Veritas.", "Labour's Elizabeth Blackman is the current MP for the seat, which she won in 1997 with a 6,932 majority.", "She plans to fight on her record and defend the government's achievements in the area.", "Kilroy-Silk will contest most seats at the general election but has not announced specific policies yet."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Robert Kilroy-Silk announces plans to contest Derbyshire's Erewash seat at the next general election, quitting UK Independence Party after months of tension over leadership."], "gemma2:2b": ["Robert Kilroy-Silk will contest the Erewash seat in the next general election.", "He formed a new party called Veritas, which aims to change politics.", "Veritas plans to contest most seats, and it has policies on immigration, crime, tax, pensions, health, and defense.", "UKIP leader Roger Knapman is glad to see Kilroy-Silk leave UKIP."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["UKIP's new political group Veritas will contest most seats at the 2018 general election but is still a short way from making its name as an alternative British politician."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Robert Kilroy-Silk is running as a member of Veritas to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash in the next general election, aiming to change politics' face and address immigration issues.", "This choice contradicts previous speculation about him opposing Labour's Geoff Hoon in Ashfield."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is contesting the Erewash seat for the next general election as a member of his new party, Veritas.", "Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 with a majority of 6,932.", "Kilroy-Silk previously quit the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and wants to \"change the face\" of UK politics.", "UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash during last June's European elections, where Kilroy-Silk was one of their candidates.", "Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970.", "Veritas plans to contest most seats at the upcoming general election and announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health, and defense over the next few weeks.", "UKIP leader Roger Knapman expressed his gladness at Kilroy-Silk leaving their party, while Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp noted that Veritas is joining \"an already crowded field.\"", "Petrina Holdsworth of UKIP suggested that Veritas will be a parody of the party they have left after its third place in June's European elections."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Kilroy names election seat target\n\nEx-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.", "Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority.", "She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\".", "Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth.", "The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics.", "His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.", "UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections -
