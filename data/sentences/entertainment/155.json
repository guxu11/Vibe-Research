{"raw_text": "Disputed Nirvana box set on sale\n \n A box set featuring 68 unreleased Nirvana tracks has gone on sale in the US, after years of legal wrangles.\n \n With the Lights Out was intended to be released in 2001, to mark the 10th anniversary of the album Nevermind. It was blocked by Courtney Love, the widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who did not want unreleased song You Know You're Right on the box set. The dispute between Love and surviving band members Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl was settled in 2002. Work began on the box set in 1998, but legal battles put the project on hold. The legal fight centred on a studio recording of the unreleased track You Know You're Right, regarded by fans as one of the unreleased gems of Nirvana. The set, released on Tuesday, features three CDs and a DVD of rare performance and rehearsal footage. The DVD also includes the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit, the track that launched Nirvana on to the international stage in 1991. \"The band wasn't always pretty, or always in tune. This is not Nirvana unplugged. It's Nirvana unedited,\" said Cobain biographer Charles Cross. The band's development ended tragically when songwriter Kurt Cobain committed suicide in April 1994.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["A box set of unreleased Nirvana tracks has been released, after years of legal disputes between Courtney Love and surviving members over the song \"You Know You're Right\".", "Work began on the project in 1998 but was put on hold due to legal battles over a studio recording.", "The set includes rare performance and rehearsal footage, including the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit."], "llama3.2:3b": ["A box set featuring 68 unreleased Nirvana tracks, \"With the Lights Out\", has gone on sale after years of legal wrangles with Courtney Love.", "Work began in 1998 but was put on hold due to disputes over an unreleased track, You Know You're Right.", "The set includes three CDs and a DVD with rare performance footage, including the first live performance of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"."], "gemma2:2b": ["A new box set featuring 68 unreleased Nirvana tracks went on sale.", "The dispute over the release was resolved in 2002, allowing the project to proceed after years of legal battles.", "The set includes three CDs and a DVD with rare footage and the song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" which launched their international fame."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["A box set featuring unreleased Nirvana tracks has gone on sale in the US, with the Lights Out album being released in 2001.", "Legal battles led to a delay in the project and a new recording of You Know You're Right, which became one of Nirvana's most important songs.", "The DVD contains footage of Smells Like Teen Spirit, but it is not intended as an unplugged recording, but rather as a showcase for unreleased music."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["A box set featuring 68 unreleased Nirvana tracks, including \"You Know You're Right\" and the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit, was released after a legal dispute with Courtney Love over an intended release for the 20th anniversary of Nevermind in 2001.", "The project began in 1998 but stalled due to disputes between Cobain's widow and surviving band members.", "The set includes three CDs and a DVD featuring rare performances and rehearsals, as well as the studio recording of \"You Know You're Right\"."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["A box set featuring 68 unreleased Nirvana tracks, originally intended for a 2001 release to mark Nevermind's tenth anniversary, went on sale after years of legal disputes.", "The main conflict involved Courtney Love, Kurt Cobain\u2019s widow, who objected to including the song You Know You're Right.", "Legal issues centered around a studio recording of this track, which fans considered an unreleased gem by Nirvana.", "Work began in 1998 but was halted due to these conflicts.", "The set released on Tuesday includes three CDs and a DVD featuring rare performance and rehearsal footage, including the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit.", "Cobain biographer Charles Cross described it as \"not Nirvana unplugged;
