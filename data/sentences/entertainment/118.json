{"raw_text": "REM concerts blighted by illness\n \n US rock band REM have been forced to cancel concerts after bass player Mike Mills was taken to hospital suffering from \"severe flu-like symptoms\".\n \n The band were forced to cut short Monday night's show in Sheffield, and have cancelled Tuesday's Glasgow date. Mills could \"hardly stand up, let alone play\", said an REM spokesman, who added he is now \"resting\" in hospital. The remainder of the band played a short acoustic set on Monday. Tuesday's gig has been rescheduled for 15 June. Those who had a ticket for the show in Glasgow are being advised to retain their ticket stub so they can attend the new date. The band's spokesman said that they would review their remaining dates on a \"day-to-day basis\", based on doctors' advice to Mills. \"Obviously we all want Mike to get better, and clearly we all want to play the shows. Rest assured we will do so as soon as possible,\" he said.\n \n The band were still hopeful they would be able to make their Wednesday date, added the spokesman. REM played accoustic versions of their hits Losing My Religion, I've Been High, Leaving New York and The One I Love to the Sheffield Arena audience on Monday. The band had originally been scheduled to play four dates in the UK as part of a world tour. In 1995 former drummer Bill Berry collapsed in Switzerland while the band was on tour, having suffered a ruptured aneurysm. He made a full recovery, only to leave the band two years later.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["US rock band REM have been forced to cancel concerts due to bassist Mike Mills' severe flu-like symptoms and hospitalization.", "The band's spokesman said Mills is currently \"resting\" in hospital and may not be able to play for some time.", "Despite this, the remaining shows will go ahead as planned on June 15.", "Those who attended Monday night's show in Sheffield were advised to retain their ticket stubs."], "llama3.2:3b": ["REM has cancelled concerts due to bass player Mike Mills' severe flu-like symptoms, which have left him unable to perform.", "The remaining shows in Sheffield and Glasgow have been rescheduled for June 15.", "The band will review their dates on a day-to-day basis based on doctors' advice."], "gemma2:2b": ["REM canceled shows in Sheffield and Glasgow due to bass player Mike Mills' severe flu-like symptoms.", "Tuesday's rescheduled concert will take place on June 15th.", "The band is hopeful of playing their Wednesday date as well.", "Mills is resting in hospital."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["REM rock band REM, which consisted of Mike Mills and the rest of their band members, have been forced to cancel concerts due to Mike Mills' severe flu-like symptoms that rendered him unable to continue playing.", "They are rescheduling two future dates for Tuesday and 15 June.", "The band was still hopeful they could make a third date after Monday's gig in Sheffield."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["REM cancelled concerts due to bass player Mike Mills' flu-like symptoms;
