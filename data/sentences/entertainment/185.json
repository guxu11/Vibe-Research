The live ceremony will be broadcast with a transmission delay on US network ABC to ensure swear words are removed. \"I've been on TV and been funny not cursing,\" he said during an interview for CBS network's 60 Minutes show. \"As far as content is concerned, I will talk about the movies. I'm not really worried about it. I'm sure ABC might be more worried about it than me,\" he added.\n \n The 40-year-old comedian caused a furore when he said in an interview with US magazine Entertainment Weekly recently that he hardly ever watched the Oscars and labelled awards ceremonies \"idiotic\". The show's producers defended Rock and confirmed that he would still be presenting the Oscar ceremony, saying his comments were \"humorous digs\".
