{"raw_text": "Horror film heads US box office\n \n A low-budget horror film produced by Evil Dead director Sam Raimi has topped the North American box office.\n \n Boogeyman, which focuses on a man who returns to his childhood home to confront his traumatic past, took $19.5m (\u00a314.9m) in three days. Last week's chart-topper, the Robert de Niro thriller Hide and Seek, fell to number four. Other new entries included The Wedding Date, a comedy starring Will and Grace's Debra Messing, at number two.\n \n The road-trip comedy Are We There Yet? and multiple Oscar nominee Million Dollar Baby completed the top five. Other Oscar contenders, including The Aviator and Sideways, continued to perform strongly at the box office. The Aviator has taken $75m (\u00a340m) so far, while Sideways has taken $46.8m (\u00a324.8m) in a more limited release.\n \n Boogeyman, which cost just $7m (\u00a33.5m) to make, performed well even though it was not screened to critics before release - normally a sign that a film will get bad reviews or perform poorly at the box office. \"I certainly believe it's a genre where people are going to be more moved by the marketing materials for the movie than by what the critics say,\" said Rory Bruer, head of distribution for Sony Pictures, which released the film in the US. Overall the weekend box office was strong despite the fact that it was American football's Super Bowl weekend - a time when cinema admissions generally fall. This year, the top 12 films grossed around $91m (\u00a348.3m), compared to 2004's Super Bowl weekend when the total box office was $73.4m (\u00a338.9m).\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Horror film Boogeyman tops US box office with $19.5m in three days.", "Robert de Niro thriller Hide and Seek fell to number four last week, while comedy Are We There Yet?", "finished at number two.", "The road-trip comedy completed the top five, with Oscar contender Million Dollar Baby taking $75m so far.", "Boogeyman was made for just $7m but performed well due to strong marketing."], "llama3.2:3b": ["A low-budget horror film \"Boogeyman\" topped the US box office, taking $19.5m in three days.", "The film cost $7m to make and performed well despite not being screened to critics beforehand.", "Other Oscar contenders like \"The Aviator\" and \"Sideways\" also did well, with \"Boogeyman\" beating last week's chart-topper \"Hide and Seek\"."], "gemma2:2b": ["Boogeyman, a low-budget horror film directed by Sam Raimi, topped the North American box office with $19.5 million in three days.", "Other notable films include The Wedding Date, Million Dollar Baby, and The Aviator which continues to perform strongly despite release date limitations.", "The strong weekend performance was due to a surge in audience engagement despite Super Bowl's impact on cinema admissions."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["A low-budget horror film that focuses on a man returning to his childhood home to confront his traumatic past has topped North American box office for three days, taking in $19.", "5 million (over $14.", "9 million USD) and falling to number four overall.", "Other new entries include Are We There Yet?", "and Million Dollar Baby, which have taken in $75 million (\u00a340 million) and $46.", "8 million (\u00a324.", "8 million) respectively.", "The Aviator and Sideways remain strong contenders for top five positions despite not being screened to critics."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["A low-budget horror film starring Sam Raimi topped North American box office with $19.5 million in three days, beating out Robert De Niro's comedy and Oscar contenders while performing well despite not being shown to critics."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["A low-budget horror film, Boogeyman, directed by Sam Raimi and produced for $7m, took the US box office top spot with $19.5m in three days.", "It outperformed last week's chart-topper, Robert de Niro\u2019s thriller Hide and Seek.", "The weekend saw Boogeyman, along with comedies like The Wedding Date starring Debra Messing, and other Oscar nominees such as Million Dollar Baby, The Aviator, and Sideways.", "Despite American football\u2019s Super Bowl being a traditional low-point for cinema admissions, the overall box office was strong this year, with top 12 films grossing around $91m, up from 2004's Super Bowl weekend total of $73.4m."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Horror film head's US box office produced by Evil Dead director Sam Raimi has topped the North American box office with a film which focuses on a man who returns to his childhood home to confront his traumatic past.", "The Boogeyman came in third place, followed by a Robert de Niro thriller Hide and Seek at number two.", "Other new entries included The Wedding Date, a comedy starring Will and Grace's Debra Messing, at number two.", "The road-trip comedy Are We There Yet?", "has been in the top five list.", "Other Oscar contenders like The Aviator and Sideways have continued to perform strongly at the box office.", "Boogeyman, which cost just $7m (\u00a33.5m) to make, performed well even though it was not screened to critics before release -
