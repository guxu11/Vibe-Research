{"raw_text": "Foxx and Swank take actors awards\n \n Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank have won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes this month.\n \n Foxx's portrayal of late soul-singer Ray Charles in Ray had already earned him a prestigious Golden Globe award. Swank triumphed for playing a gutsy female boxer in Million Dollar Baby. Modest wine country comedy Sideways knocked out favourites Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator by taking the top prize for best cast performance.\n \n The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) represents US film and TV actors. Its winners often go on to win Oscars. In other nominations, Cate Blanchett triumphed as the best supporting actress for her role as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator. Veteran actor Morgan Freeman took the best supporting actor award for playing a prize-fighter turned gym manager in Million Dollar Baby.\n \n \"Thank you for Ray Charles for just living so complex and so interesting, and making us all just come together,\" said Foxx, accepting his award in Los Angeles on Saturday.\n \n He also praised the film director: \"Thank you for Taylor Hackford for taking a chance with an African-American film. Taylor, you're my director of the year.\" Swank, too, was full of praise for her director and co-star Clint Eastwood. \"I bow down to you,\" Swank said to the 74-year-old Eastwood. \"You are a talent beyond compare. If I'm half the person you are and half the talent you are when I'm 74, I will know that I've accomplished something great.\"\n \n Both Foxx and Swank are now considered to be among the favourites to get Oscars - the Hollywood's ultimate prize. However, Swank has to overcome a strong challenge from Annette Bening, a nominee for the theatre farce Being Julia. Meanwhile, ballots for Oscars - the Hollywood's top honours - were mailed earlier this week to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The voting is due to end on 22 February - five days before the ceremony.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Jamie Foxx won a Screen Actors Guild Award for best male film actor, his third Oscar win in four years.", "Hilary Swank also won for her role in Million Dollar Baby, which she praised Taylor Hackford and Clint Eastwood for their work on.", "Foxx said \"Thank you\" to Hackford, praising him as director of the year.", "He also acknowledged his co-star Clint Eastwood, who he called a talent beyond compare."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Jamie Foxx won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best male film actor, beating Ray Charles' portrayal in \"Ray\" had already earned him a Golden Globe award.", "Hilary Swank won as the best female film actor for her role in \"Million Dollar Baby\".", "Cate Blanchett took the supporting actress award and Morgan Freeman won supporting actor.", "Foxx praised director Taylor Hackford and Swank paid tribute to director Clint Eastwood."], "gemma2:2b": ["Jamie Foxx won best actor for his portrayal of Ray Charles in \"Ray\", while Hilary Swank took home best actress for her role as a female boxer in \"Million Dollar Baby\".", "\"Sideways\" received the top prize for cast performance, and Cate Blanchett was recognized for supporting actress in \"The Aviator\".", "Morgan Freeman won the supporting actor award for \"Million Dollar Baby.\"", "Both Foxx and Swank are considered frontrunners for Oscars."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Fox & Swank win SAG awards in Los Angeles."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank have won Screen Actors Guild Awards, which are often followed by Oscar nominations.", "Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles in \"Ray\" earned him a Golden Globe, while Swank triumphed for her role in \"Million Dollar Baby\".", "Both actors now face competition from Annette Bening for the Oscars."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank won Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes.", "Foxx portrayed Ray Charles in \"Ray\" and Swank played a boxer in \"Million Dollar Baby.\"", "Modest comedy \"Sideways\" took top prize for best cast performance.", "Other winners included Cate Blanchett (best supporting actress for \"The Aviator\") and Morgan Freeman (best supporting actor for \"Million Dollar Baby\").", "Both Foxx and Swank are considered Oscar favorites, while Swank faces competition from Annette Bening.", "Voting for Oscars begins this week and ends before the ceremony."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Foxx and Swank have won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes this month.", "Foxx's portrayal of late soul-singer Ray Charles in Ray had already earned him a prestigious Golden Globe award.", "Swank triumphed for playing a gutsy female boxer in Million Dollar Baby.", "The film Sideways knocked out favourites Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator by taking the top prize for best cast performance.", "The SAG represents US film and TV actors.", "Its winners often go on to win Oscars.", "In other nominations, Cate Blanchett triumphed as the best supporting actress for her role as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator.", "\"He thankfully accepted his award in Los Angeles on Saturday.\"", "\"Taylor Hackford also praised the director,\" said Swank.", "\"The film director is a fantastic addition to the cast of The Aviator.\"", "Both Foxx and Swank are now considered to be among the favourites to get Oscars -
