{"raw_text": "Foxx and Swank win US awards\n \n Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank have won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes this month.\n \n Foxx's portrayal of late soul-singer Ray Charles in Ray had already earned him a prestigious Golden Globe award. Swank triumphed for playing a gutsy female boxer in Million Dollar Baby. Modest wine country comedy Sideways knocked out favourites Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator by taking the top prize for best cast performance.\n \n The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) represents US film and TV actors. Its winners often go on to win Oscars. In other nominations, Cate Blanchett triumphed as the best supporting actress for her role as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator. Veteran actor Morgan Freeman took the best supporting actor award for playing a prize-fighter turned gym manager in Million Dollar Baby.\n \n \"Thank you for Ray Charles for just living so complex and so interesting, and making us all just come together,\" said Foxx, accepting his award in Los Angeles on Saturday.\n \n He also praised the film director: \"Thank you for Taylor Hackford for taking a chance with an African-American film. Taylor, you're my director of the year.\" Swank, too, was full of praise for her director and co-star Clint Eastwood. \"I bow down to you,\" Swank said to the 74-year-old Eastwood. \"You are a talent beyond compare. If I'm half the person you are and half the talent you are when I'm 74, I will know that I've accomplished something great.\"\n \n Both Foxx and Swank are now considered to be among the favourites to get Oscars - the Hollywood's ultimate prize. However, Swank has to overcome a strong challenge from Annette Bening, a nominee for the theatre farce Being Julia. Meanwhile, ballots for Oscars - the Hollywood's top honours - were mailed earlier this week to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The voting is due to end on 22 February - five days before the ceremony.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank won US awards at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, including Foxx's Golden Globe award for his role in Ray Charles.", "They also took home SAG honors for best cast performance in Sideways and best female lead in Million Dollar Baby.", "Cate Blanchett won as supporting actress for her role in The Aviator, while Morgan Freeman won for his role in Million Dollar Baby."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes.", "Foxx's Golden Globe award-winning performance as Ray Charles earned him the SAG award, while Swank took home the prize for her role in Million Dollar Baby.", "Cate Blanchett won as the best supporting actress, and Morgan Freeman took the best supporting actor award for his role in the same film."], "gemma2:2b": ["Jamie Foxx won best male actor for \"Ray\", Hilary Swank won best female actor for \"Million Dollar Baby\" and \"Sideways\" won best cast performance.", "Cate Blanchett won best supporting actress and Morgan Freeman won best supporting actor.", "Both Foxx and Swank are considered top Oscar contenders."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank won SAG awards in film, taking the best male and female roles respectively.", "They were also nominated for Oscar.", "Foxx's Ray Charles role earned him a Golden Globe award.", "Swank's Million Dollar Baby was the top film in Best Cast.", "Cate Blanchett and Morgan Freeman received Academy Award nominations and wins.", "Foxx praised director Taylor Hackford, while Swank celebrated Clint Eastwood with \"You Are A Talent\".", "Both won at the highest Oscars level -
