Paramount Pictures, the studio behind the film, have revealed few details about the project but say it has the potential to spawn a series of films. Lee is best known for his work on Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk.\n \n He is collaborating on the script with screenwriter Peter Briggs, who penned the recent comic book adaptation Hellboy. \"We believe it to be truly a whole new franchise,\" said Gill Champion, president and chief executive of Lee's POW! Entertainment. \"In this world where people are looking for something different, Stan's idea was to create a concept not seen before to become an evergreen franchise for Paramount.\" Many of Lee's other creations, including X-Men and Daredevil, have been turned into films in the past five years. However, the Spider-Man series has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (\u00a3857m) worldwide.
