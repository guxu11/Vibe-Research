{"raw_text": "Double eviction from Big Brother\n \n Model Caprice and Holby City actor Jeremy Edwards have both left the Celebrity Big Brother house in a surprise double eviction on Friday.\n \n Caprice, who left in the scheduled fourth eviction having gained just 5% of the public vote, afterwards said: \"I am so happy, I am so glad I'm out.\" Edwards then left in a surprise eviction, with 12% of the vote. Nineteen-year-old Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie is currently favourite to win the \u00a350,000 charity prize. Caprice had been the pre-show favourite to be voted out of the house, with bookmakers Ladbrokes offering odds of 1/5 on her departure. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush had said she was \"the hottest eviction favourite so far this series\".\n \n Odds on Kenzie's victory have been slashed from 4/6 to 1/2, although bookmakers have said they are not ruling out a late rally from former Happy Mondays star Bez. The other remaining housemate is actress Brigitte Nielsen. DJ Lisa I'Anson became the third housemate to be voted out on Wednesday when she became the victim of a surprise eviction during a game of hide-and-seek on the Channel 4 show. I'Anson said she was \"glad to be out\" and predicted that Kenzie would emerge as the winner. The winner is due to be announced on Sunday night.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Jeremy Edwards and Caprice are both leaving Celebrity Big Brother in a double eviction, with Edwards being surprised to leave after gaining 12% of the vote, while Caprice was previously expected to be evicted.", "Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie has been favourite to win the \u00a350,000 charity prize, but bookmakers have reduced her odds from 4/6 to 1/2 following a surprise eviction."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Jeremy Edwards and Model Caprice left Celebrity Big Brother in a surprise double eviction.", "Caprice had been the pre-show favourite but gained only 5% of the vote, while Edwards got 12%.", "Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie is now favourite to win the \u00a350,000 charity prize."], "gemma2:2b": ["Jeremy Edwards and Caprice were both evicted from Celebrity Big Brother in a double eviction on Friday.", "Kenzie is now the favorite to win the \u00a350,000 prize, with odds slashed after her high vote count.", "The remaining housemate is Brigitte Nielsen."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["A surprise double eviction from Big Brother has occurred in which actress Jeremy Edwards left with a 5% vote share, while Caprice won only 12% of the public vote.", "In contrast, Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie became the favourite to win the \u00a350,000 charity prize.", "TV show host Jack Frost was voted out during a game on Channel 4, but his departure from the house has since been announced as a surprise eviction."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Celebs Big Brother: Jeremy Edwards and Caprice have been evicted, leaving Kenzie as favourite for \u00a350k prize.", "Bookmakers cut odds from 1/5 to 1/2 on Kenzie's victory.", "Lisa I'Anson was voted out after being caught cheating in a game show."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Celebrity Big Brother saw model Caprice and actor Jeremy Edwards evicted in a surprise double eviction on Friday.", "Caprice, initially favoured to leave, left after gaining 5% of the public vote, while Edwards was evicted with 12%.", "Kenzie is now the favourite to win the \u00a350,000 charity prize with odds slashed from 4/6 to 1/2, though former Happy Mondays star Bez remains a potential late entry.", "Actress Brigitte Nielsen and DJ Lisa I'Anson are the other remaining housemates;
