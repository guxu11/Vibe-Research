{"raw_text": "British stars denied major Oscars\n \n British hopes of winning major Oscars were dashed as UK stars failed to win acting and directing prizes.\n \n Despite three nominations, Mike Leigh's Vera Drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star Imelda Staunton. Kate Winslet also lost to best actress Hilary Swank, while Clive Owen and Sophie Okonedo failed to win best supporting actor awards. The UK's Andrea Arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama Wasp.\n \n Arnold, who presented children's television shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, said it was \"totally overwhelming\" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar.\n \n \"Everyone worked extremely hard - they know who they are,\" Arnold said as she accepted the prize. \"The beers are on me when we get home.\" Earlier British costume designer Sandy Powell won the Oscar for The Aviator, beating Finding Neverland's UK designer Alexandra Byrne in the process. \"I'm very thrilled for the film and all the people who worked with me,\" said Ms Powell. \"Hopefully I'll be staying up to celebrate - I've been sick for three days and want to make it through the night.\" The British visual effects team behind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban were less fortunate, however, losing the Oscar in that category to Spider-Man 2. Before Sunday's ceremony Owen was bookmakers' favourite for his role in romantic drama Closer that had already clinched him a Golden Globe award. It was the first time actress Okonedo had been shortlisted, chosen for her performance in Hotel Rwanda about the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It was also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who played abortionist Vera Drake in Mike Leigh's film.\n \n Leigh had previously received three Oscar nominations for Secrets and Lies and Topsy Turvy. Winslet said she was \"ecstatic\" about the fourth Oscar nomination of her career, this time for her lead role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Among other British talent nominated for Oscars, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart were nominated for best original song for Learn To Be Lonely, from The Phantom of the Opera movie. That award was won by Al Otro Lado Del Rio from The Motorcycle Diaries. Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, was also up for The Phantom of the Opera but lost to The Aviator. Finding Neverland garnered another nomination for British talent, with Gemma Jackson shortlisted for the art direction prize. She lost in that category to The Aviator. A spokesman for the UK Film Council said: \"It is disappointing not to have more British winners.\" He added: \"It was extraordinary to have 24 British nominees in the initial list of nominees.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["British stars, including Mike Leigh and Kate Winslet, failed to win major Oscars despite three nominations.", "Imelda Staunton was snubbed for best actress.", "British costume designer Sandy Powell won for The Aviator, beating Alexandra Byrne.", "Visual effects team behind Harry Potter lost to Spider-Man 2."], "llama3.2:3b": ["British stars failed to win major Oscars despite three nominations, with Andrea Arnold winning the short film award for her drama Wasp.", "Kate Winslet lost best actress to Hilary Swank, while Clive Owen and Sophie Okonedo were nominated but did not win acting awards.", "Sandy Powell won costume design for The Aviator, and a British visual effects team was nominated but lost in that category."], "gemma2:2b": ["British actors and filmmakers were largely unsuccessful at the Oscars, with no major awards being won by UK stars despite several nominations.", "While Andrea Arnold won the short film award for \"Wasp,\" other nominated Brits like Kate Winslet and Clive Owen lost their respective categories.", "Costume designer Sandy Powell won the Oscar for costume design in The Aviator.", "Despite British talent making a significant number of nominations, the Oscars went to international filmmakers and projects."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["UK actors won few Oscars this year, with fewer major prizes given out than expected."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["British actors and directors missed out on major Oscar nominations, with Mike Leigh's Vera Drake and Andrea Arnold winning awards for their short films.", "Oscars were awarded to UK costume designer Sandy Powell and visual effects team behind Harry Potter film, while Britain was left without a winner in cinematography category for The Aviator."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["British hopes of major Oscars were dashed with no acting or directing wins despite three nominations for Mike Leigh's Vera Drake.", "Imelda Staunton and Clive Owen failed to win best supporting actor awards, while Kate Winslet lost to Hilary Swank.", "Only Andrea Arnold, whose Wasp won the short film award, claimed success.", "Sandy Powell, UK costume designer of The Aviator, expressed joy at her win but criticized Alexandra Byrne for winning Finding Neverland.", "British visual effects team and Okonedo, who debuted with a nomination in Hotel Rwanda, were unsuccessful.", "Other nominees included composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and cinematographer John Mathieson.", "The UK Film Council noted disappointment without more winners among 24 British nominations."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["British stars, especially those who won major Oscars, have experienced a series of controversies.", "They denied their own nominations but have struggled with securing them furthermore they failed to win major Oscars.", "The disappointing results have left several critics concerned about the 'culture of failure' and its impact on film-making globally.", "This highlights why it is critical to understand the significance of individual Oscar-nominees, rather than just looking at all the nominees."], "smollm:1.7b": ["British stars denied major Oscars"], "deepseek-r1:1.5b": ["British stars faced challenges in the Oscars despite nominations, with several winners and losers highlighted.", "Key points include Kate Winslet winning Best Actress, Andrea Arnold winning short film prizes, Sandy Powell winning The Aviator, Leila de Silvano winning Best Original Song for \"The Motorcycle Diaries,\" Clive Owen winning best supporting actor awards, Aron Rambach taking Best Director, Clive Owen winning Best Supporting Actor, and Leila de Silvano winning Best Performance in a Film.", "The UK Film Council's overview noted their impact despite losing major Oscar wins."], "tinyllama:1.1b": ["The following are key ideas and details from the text:\n\n- Despite three nominations, Mike Leigh's Vera Drake failed to take the director or screenplay award;
