{"raw_text": "Early Elvis recordings go on sale\n \n Some of Elvis Presley's earliest recordings - including takes of All Shook Up - are going under the hammer on Sunday at a Los Angeles auction.\n \n The six unedited reel-to-reel tapes - which were owned by the engineer who recorded them - are valued at up to $50,000 (\u00a329,000). Highlights of the two hour-long collection will get their public debut at Bonhams auction house on Saturday. The RCA tapes date from September 1956 to September 1957. The \"pre-masters\" include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and engineer Thorne Nogar.\n \n \"We've had them for a lot of years, and I think the people should enjoy them,\" Nogar's son Stephen, 57, said. \"And frankly, we could use the money.\" Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs. \"He called them his ass-saver tapes,\" his son said. The quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record. Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes can only be sold for \"personal enjoyment\" and they cannot be copied for commercial gain.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Elvis Presley's early recordings are being sold at an auction in Los Angeles on Sunday for up to $50,000.", "The six unedited reel-to-reel tapes date back to 1956-57 and include takes from songs such as \"All Shook Up\" and \"Jailhouse Rock\"."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Elvis Presley's early recordings, including unedited reel-to-reel tapes from 1956-1957, are up for sale at a Los Angeles auction valued at up to $50,000.", "The collection, which includes takes of \"All Shook Up\" and other songs, will be sold as personal enjoyment only due to copyright restrictions."], "gemma2:2b": ["Elvis Presley's early recordings from 1956-1957, including unreleased takes of \"All Shook Up\" and other material, are being auctioned in Los Angeles.", "Six unedited reel-to-reel tapes are expected to fetch up to $50,000.", "The tapes include snippets of songs, banter between Elvis and his band members, and parts for his first Christmas album."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Elvis Presley's early recordings have recently been auctioned off at Bonhams, valued at up to $50, 000 (\u00a329, 000).", "Highlights from the tapes include material from his first Christmas album, Jailhouse Rock, a take of All Shook Up, religious songs, banter between Presley and members of his band, and a recording of him singing \"All I Can Do Is Talk.\"", "The tapes date back to September 1956 to September 1957, and are unedited reel-to-reel reels.", "They feature material such as Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, the lyrics for \"Saturday Night Fever,\" and a take of \"Just like That.\"", "The quality is said to be noticeably crisp compared to new vinyl records.", "Because the tapes are not owned by the original copyright holders, they cannot be copied for commercial gain."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Elvis Presley's earliest recordings go on sale at auction in Los Angeles;
