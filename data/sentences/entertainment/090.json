{"raw_text": "Berlin cheers for anti-Nazi film\n \n A German movie about an anti-Nazi resistance heroine has drawn loud applause at Berlin Film Festival.\n \n Sophie Scholl - The Final Days portrays the final days of the member of the White Rose movement. Scholl, 21, was arrested and beheaded with her brother, Hans, in 1943 for distributing leaflets condemning the \"abhorrent tyranny\" of Adolf Hitler. Director Marc Rothemund said: \"I have a feeling of responsibility to keep the legacy of the Scholls going.\" \"We must somehow keep their ideas alive,\" he added.\n \n The film drew on transcripts of Gestapo interrogations and Scholl's trial preserved in the archive of communist East Germany's secret police. Their discovery was the inspiration behind the film for Rothemund, who worked closely with surviving relatives, including one of Scholl's sisters, to ensure historical accuracy on the film. Scholl and other members of the White Rose resistance group first started distributing anti-Nazi leaflets in the summer of 1942. They were arrested as they dropped leaflets at Munich University calling for a \"day of reckoning\" with Adolf Hitler's regime. The film focuses on the six days from Scholl's arrest to the intense trial which saw Scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance. It is one of three German films vying for a top prize at the Festival.\n \n A South African film version of Bizet's tragic opera Carmen shot in Cape Town in the Xhosa language has also premiered at the Berlin Festival. The film is entitled U-Carmen eKhayelitsha or Carmen in Khayelitsha after the township in which the story is set. It is performed by a 40-strong music and theatre troupe in their debut film performance. The film is the first South African feature in 25 years and only the second to be nominated for a Golden Bear Award.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["A German movie, Sophie Scholl - The Final Days, about an anti-Nazi resistance heroine, has received applause at the Berlin Film Festival.", "The film uses transcripts of Gestapo interrogations and includes historical accuracy from surviving relatives.", "It follows the six days leading up to Scholl's arrest and trial.", "A South African film version of Carmen premiered at the festival in Cape Town."], "llama3.2:3b": ["A German movie about anti-Nazi heroine Sophie Scholl has received loud applause at Berlin Film Festival, showcasing her final days leading up to her arrest and execution.", "The film drew on transcripts and worked with surviving relatives to ensure historical accuracy.", "It is one of three German films competing for a top prize at the festival.", "A South African film version of Bizet's Carmen also premiered, performed by a 40-strong music and theatre troupe in their debut film performance."], "gemma2:2b": ["A German movie about Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi resistance member, was praised at the Berlin Film Festival.", "The movie focuses on her final days before trial and capture, drawing from historical records and her family's involvement.", "Another film premiered at the festival featuring a South African adaptation of Bizet's \"Carmen\" performed in Xhosa language, marking a significant milestone for the country's cinema."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["A German movie about an anti-Nazi resistance heroine has drawn applause at the Berlin Film Festival, with the final days of the member of the White Rose movement being portrayed by director Marc Rothemund.", "The film focuses on six days from Scholl's arrest to her defiant appearance, while a South African film version of Bizet's opera Carmen is also showcasing talent in Cape Town."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Berlin Film Festival honors anti-Nazi film about Sophie Scholl, with focus on German resistance heroines."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["A German movie about Sophie Scholl, a member of the White Rose movement who was arrested for anti-Nazi leaflets, has received applause at Berlin Film Festival.", "Directed by Marc Rothemund, the film draws from Gestapo interrogations and trials preserved in communist East Germany's archive.", "It focuses on six days from her arrest to trial.", "A South African version of Bizet\u2019s opera Carmen shot in Cape Town premiered concurrently.", "This is the first South African feature in 25 years and only the second to be nominated for a Golden Bear Award at the Festival."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Berlin cheers for anti-Nazi film.", "A German movie about an anti-Nazi resistance heroine has drawn loud applause at Berlin Film Festival.", "Sophie Scholl -
