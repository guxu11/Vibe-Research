{"raw_text": "Mutant book wins Guardian prize\n \n A book about the evolution of mutants and the science of abnormality has won the Guardian First Book Award 2004.\n \n Armand Marie Leroi, a lecturer at London's Imperial College, scooped the \u00a310,000 prize for Mutants: On the form, varieties and errors of the human body. \"It is profoundly cultured and beautifully written in the very best tradition of popular science writing today,\" said judge Claire Armistead. The award recognises and rewards new writing across fiction and non-fiction. A panel of literary experts, including novelists Hari Kunzru and Ali Smith, director Sir Richard Eyre and comedian Alexei Sayle chose the winner from a five-strong shortlist.\n \n The shortlist included Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, a novel about the magic arts at the turn of the 19th Century and The Places In Between, Rory Stewart's account of his trek, on foot, across Afghanistan. \"What we found so impressive about Armand Marie Leroi's book was the scope of its reference, its elegance and its inquisitiveness,\" said Ms Armistead, chair of the judges and the Guardian literary editor. \"While the subject matter of Mutants unsettled some involved in the judging process, the overwhelming majority found it fascinating,\" she added. Her words were echoed by Iris director Sir Richard Eyre who called Marie Leroi's work \"extraordinarily thought provoking\". The award, for first time authors, is open to books from genres including fiction, poetry, biography, memoir, history, politics, science and current affairs. Previous winners include White Teeth by Zadie Smith, in 2000, which went on to become a bestseller.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["A book about the evolution of mutants won the Guardian First Book Award in 2004, with a panel of literary experts selecting Armand Marie Leroi's Mutants: On the form, varieties and errors of the human body as the winner.", "The judge praised its \"profoundly cultured\" writing and reference to science."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Armand Marie Leroi won the Guardian First Book Award 2004 for \"Mutants: On the form, varieties and errors of the human body\", a book about the evolution of mutants and abnormality, praised for its scope, elegance, and inquisitiveness."], "gemma2:2b": ["The Guardian First Book Award 2004 has been won by Armand Marie Leroi for his book \"Mutants: On the form, varieties and errors of the human body\".", "Leroi's work was chosen from a shortlist that also included Susanna Clarke's novel and Rory Stewart's account of his trek.", "The judges praised Leroi's scope of reference, elegance, and inquisitiveness."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["A book about the evolution of mutants won the Guardian First Book Award 2004.", "The author is Armand Marie Leroi, an Imperial College lecturer, and the book was nominated for the \u00a310,000 Guardian Prize.", "It's written in popular science style with beautiful writing and elegance.", "The judges praised the book's scope of reference, its elegance, and its curiosity.", "Some people found it challenging, but others found it fascinating.", "The award is open to books across genres including fiction, poetry, biography, memoir, history, politics, science, and current affairs.", "Previous winners include White Teeth by Zadie Smith in 2000."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Mutant book \"Mutants: On the Form, Varieties, and Errors of the Human Body\" wins Guardian First Book Award for 2004, praised for its cultural depth and readability.", "Judge Claire Armistead described it as \"cultured and beautifully written in today's popular science tradition.\"", "The winner is Armand Marie Leroi from London's Imperial College, with Susanna Clarke's \"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\" and Rory Stewart's \"The Places In Between\" also shortlisted."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Mutants: On the Form, Varieties and Errors of the Human Body, authored by Armand Marie Leroi, won the Guardian First Book Award 2004.", "The book addresses the evolution of mutants and abnormality in science.", "It was chosen from a five-member shortlist for its cultured quality, elegance, and inquiry.", "Judges praised its broad referencing and fascinating subject matter despite some initial skepticism.", "Previous winners include Zadie Smith's White Teeth."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["\"A book about the evolution of mutants and the science of abnormality has won the Guardian First Book Award 2004.", "A lecturer at London's Imperial College scooped the \u00a310,000 prize for Mutants: On the form, varieties and errors of the human body.", "It is profoundly cultured and beautifully written in the very best tradition of popular science writing today.\"", "-Judge Claire Armistead.", "The winning book was chosen from a five-strong shortlist by literary experts."], "smollm:1.7b": ["The summary should be concise and focus on the main ideas of the text:\n\n1.", "Mutant book wins Guardian prize (main idea)\n2.", "Armand Marie Leroi's book won the Guardian First Book Award 2004 (supporting details)\n3.", "The shortlist included Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, a novel about the magic arts at the turn of the 19th Century, and The Places In Between, Rory Stewart's account of his trek, on foot, across Afghanistan (supporting details)\n4.", "The judges praised Leroi's book for its scope, elegance, and inquisitiveness (main idea)\n5.", "While some involved in the judging process found the subject matter unsettling, the majority found it fascinating (main idea)"], "deepseek-r1:1.5b": ["Mutants: On the Form, co-authored by Armand Marie Leroi, won the Guardian First Book Award 2004.", "The book explores mutant books and their evolution through science, with Leroi recognized for his writing style.", "A panel of literary experts selected it from a five-book shortlist.", "The award recognizes first-time authors across various genres, including fiction and non-fiction."], "tinyllama:1.1b": ["The Guardian Prize has awarded its top literary prize of the year -
