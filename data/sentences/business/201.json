{"raw_text": "Novartis hits acquisition trail\n \n Swiss drugmaker Novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ($7.4bn; \u00a33.9bn) of purchases to make its Sandoz unit the world's biggest generic drug producer.\n \n Novartis, which last month forecast record sales for 2005, said it had bought all of Germany's Hexal. It also acquired 67.7% of Hexal's US affiliate Eon Labs, and offered to buy the remaining shares for $31 each. Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a year following the acquisitions. Novartis' shares rose 1% to 57.85 Swiss francs in early trading.\n \n The deal will see Novartis' Sandoz business overtake Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals as the world's biggest maker of generics. Based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than $5bn, the company estimated. Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts.\n \n \"The strong growth outlook for Sandoz, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,\" the firm said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals. Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost.\n \n There are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. However, not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal. \"This is a very expensive acquisition,\" Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, told Reuters. \"I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Novartis has announced acquiring Sandoz for 5.65bn euros to become the world's largest generic drug producer.", "The deal includes buying all of Germany's Hexal and its US affiliate Eon Labs, with a potential $31 share offer.", "This will make Sandoz overtake Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals as the biggest generic maker."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Novartis has announced \u20ac5.65 billion ($7.4 billion) in purchases to make its Sandoz unit the world's largest generic drug producer.", "It acquired all of Germany's Hexal and 67.7% of US affiliate Eon Labs, offering to buy remaining shares for $31 each.", "The deal will see Sandoz surpass Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals as the world's largest maker of generics, with estimated sales over $5 billion in 2004."], "gemma2:2b": ["Novartis acquired Hexal and Eon Labs to make its Sandoz unit the world's largest generic drug producer, overtaking Teva Pharmaceuticals.", "This merger is expected to generate cost savings of $200 million annually and merge departments, potentially leading to job cuts.", "The deal will significantly boost Sandoz's sales to over $5 billion.", "While some analysts were skeptical about the cost, others believe this move aligns with a market trend toward consolidation in the fragmented generic drug industry."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Novartis acquires Hexal and Eon Labs for $31 each.", "The acquisition is expected to boost generic drug production by more than $5 billion per year.", "However, some analysts are concerned about potential job cuts in the merged company."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Swiss drugmaker Novartis has purchased Germany's Hexal and 67.7% of its US affiliate Eon Labs for $5.65 billion euros to make Sandoz the world's largest generic drug producer, aiming to boost sales from $5 billion in 2004 by 2010 while making cost savings of about $200 million annually through departmental mergers and job cuts.", "The acquisitions will enable Novartis to overtake Teva Pharmaceuticals as the biggest generics maker and create jobs despite potential workforce reductions."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Novartis acquires Hexal and Eon Labs to create Sandoz as the world's largest generic drug producer for $7.4bn.", "The acquisition is expected to save Novartis about $200m annually, making it a leading player in generics market with sales exceeding $5bn based on 2004 figures.", "However, the deal may lead to job cuts due to planned department mergers and anticipated generic drug price pressures despite strong growth prospects for Sandoz.", "Some analysts questioned the high cost of the acquisition."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Novartis hits an acquisition deal to gain control over Sandoz, which has made Germany's largest generic drug producer.", "The company announced a $5.65bn purchase followed by a buy-off deal with Israel's Teva.", "Novartis is forecasting a 2005 sales record and has bought all of Germany's Hexal.", "It also acquired an affiliate firm Eon Labs to buy shares for $31 each in return for saving about $200m per year.", "The acquisition saw the company's Sandoz business taking over Israel's Teva as the world's largest maker of generic drugs, based on 2004 figures.", "Novartis has merged many departments and will make approximately $5bn in sales after the acquisitions."], "smollm:1.7b": ["The summary should preserve key ideas and details of the original text:\n\n1.", "**Key idea**: Novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ($7.4bn;
