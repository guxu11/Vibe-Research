{"raw_text": "Rescue hope for Borussia Dortmund\n \n Shares in struggling German football club Borussia Dortmund slipped on Monday despite the club agreeing a rescue plan with creditors on Friday.\n \n The club, which has posted record losses and racked up debts, said last week that it was in \"a life-threatening profitability and financial situation\". Creditors agreed on Friday to suspend interest payments until 2007. News of the deal had boosted shares in the club on Friday, but the stock slipped back 7% during Monday morning.\n \n In addition to the interest-payment freeze, Borussia Dortmund also will get short-term loans to help pay salaries. It estimated that it needs almost 30m euros ($39m; \u00a321m) until the end of June if it is to pay its bills. The football club is hoping that all its creditors will agree to defer rent payments on its Westfalen stadium. Borussia officials met with almost all the banks involved in its financing on Friday and over the weekend. Three creditors have yet to agree to the deal struck last week. On 14 March, one of these creditors - property investment fund Molsiris which owns the club's stadium - holds its AGM at which it will discuss the rescue plan. Chief executive Gerd Niebaum stepped down last week and creditors have been pushing for a greater say in how the club is run. Borussia Dortmund also is facing calls to appoint executives from outside the club. The club posted a record loss of 68m euros in the 12 months through June. Adding to its woes, Borussia Dortmund was beaten 5-0 by Bayern Munich on Saturday.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Borussia Dortmund shares fell after agreeing with creditors on a rescue plan despite posting record losses and debts.", "The club said it needs \u20ac29 million until June to pay bills and has asked for short-term loans to help cover salaries.", "Creditors agreed to defer rent payments on the Westfalen stadium, but three have yet to agree to the deal."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Borussia Dortmund agreed with creditors on Friday to suspend interest payments until 2007 and receive short-term loans to pay salaries.", "Shares slipped back 7% after the initial boost, amid reports that three creditors have yet to agree to the deal.", "The club estimated it needs nearly 30m euros by June to pay bills, including rent for its Westfalen stadium, which is owned by a creditor holding an AGM on March 14."], "gemma2:2b": ["Borussia Dortmund's shares dropped despite agreeing a debt rescue plan with creditors on Friday.", "The deal includes interest payment suspension and short-term loans to cover salary expenses.", "The club hopes for rent payment deferrals from its stadium landlord, but three creditors remain undecided.", "A key meeting is planned for March 14th to discuss the agreement.", "Borussia Dortmund faces financial struggles and a significant loss in revenue.", "Their latest defeat to Bayern Munich has added to these challenges."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Borussia Dortmund's shares fell after agreeing with creditors and receiving short-term loans, which helped boost shares but also faced financial problems including debts and profitability issues."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["German football club Borussia Dortmund's shares fell after agreeing to a loan and interest-payment suspension plan but failed to fully recover from Friday's rise following creditors' agreement.", "The club needs \u20ac30 million until June 2019 to cover bills, with some lenders still refusing the deal struck earlier.", "The rescue efforts include short-term loans for salaries and rent deferments on stadium payments."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Rescue plan agreed for struggling Borussia Dortmund but shares slip after Friday's deal.", "Club reported record losses and debts, with creditors suspending interest payments until 2007, boosting Friday's stock.", "Needs \u20ac30m by June to pay bills;
