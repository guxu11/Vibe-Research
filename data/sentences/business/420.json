{"raw_text": "India and Iran in gas export deal\n \n India has signed a $40bn (\u00a321bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran.\n \n Firms led by the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will also assist in the development of Iranian oil fields. Ministers, eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy, secured a similar deal to one between Iran and China. The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos. The agreements with Iran were sealed after talks in New Delhi between Middle East producers and Asia's biggest energy consumers - China, India, Japan and South Korea.\n \n Iran - Opec's second-biggest oil producer and one of the world's top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals, rewarding LNG buyers with participation in development of its oil fields. Under the agreement, it will supply India with 7.5 million tonnes of LPG annually over a 25 year period from 2009. ONGC and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) reached a preliminary deal for Indian firms to take part in the development of the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, both countries said in a statement. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. Consumption has jumped to 2.4 million barrels per day, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["India signs $40bn deal for liquefied natural gas from Iran.", "Iran agrees to supply 7.5m tonnes of LPG annually to India over 25 years.", "ONGC and NIOC reach a preliminary agreement for Indian firms to develop Iran's oilfields.", "India imports about 70% of its oil consumption, with consumption increasing by 2.4 million barrels per day."], "llama3.2:3b": ["India has signed a $40bn deal to import 7.5m tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran annually over 25 years.", "Indian firms will also assist in the development of Iranian oil fields under the agreement which rewards LNG buyers with participation in oil field development.", "India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption, which has jumped to 2.4 million barrels per day."], "gemma2:2b": ["India and Iran have agreed on a $40 billion deal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Iran over a period of 25 years.", "This agreement also includes ONGC assisting in the development of Iranian oil fields.", "The deal comes as India seeks to secure energy supplies amid rapid economic growth.", "It's part of a larger trend of international agreements by Iran for LNG purchase and oil field development, particularly with Asian countries like China, India, Japan, and South Korea."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["India and Iran have signed a $40bn deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Iran, with firms led by the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation of India (ONGC).", "The agreement will also help ONGC develop oil fields in Iran.", "China has also negotiated a similar deal with Iran and Russia's Yukos company to buy former assets of its troubled oil firm."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["India signs $40 billion deal with Iran for liquefied natural gas and oil field development assistance.", "Deals also announced for ONGC's acquisition of Yukos assets."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["India has signed a $40bn deal with Iran for millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas imports and development of Iranian oil fields.", "This deal is part of Iran's strategy to secure energy supply from LNG buyers by offering them participation in its oil field development.", "Under the agreement, Iran will supply India 7.5 million tonnes of LPG annually over a 25-year period starting from 2009.", "Indian firms like ONGC are participating in the development of two Iranian oilfields -
