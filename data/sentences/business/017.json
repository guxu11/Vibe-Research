{"raw_text": "Parmalat boasts doubled profits\n \n Parmalat, the Italian food group at the centre of one of Europe's most painful corporate scandals, has reported a doubling in profit.\n \n Its pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter were 77m euros (\u00a353m; $100m), up from 38m in the same period of 2003. Less welcome was the news that the firm had been fined 11m euros for having violated takeover rules five years ago. The firm sought bankruptcy protection in December 2003 after disclosing a 4bn-euro hole in its accounts. Overall, the company's debt is close to 12bn euros, and is falling only slowly. Its brands, well-known in Italy and overseas, have continued to perform strongly, however, and have barely lost revenue since the scandal broke.\n \n But a crucial factor for the company's future is the legal unwinding of its intensely complex financial position. On Tuesday, the company's administrator, turnaround expert Enrico Bondi, sued Morgan Stanley, its former banker, to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal. That brought to 49 the number of banks that Mr Bondi has sued, a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros. The company has also sued former auditors and financial advisors for damages. And criminal cases against the company's former management are proceeding separately.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Parmalat reports doubled profits due to a significant increase in pre-tax earnings to \u20ac77m, despite being fined \u20ac11m for violating takeover rules five years ago.", "The company has debt of \u20ac12bn and is falling slowly from its 2003 level.", "A legal process involving banks, auditors, financial advisors, and former management is ongoing, worth up to \u20ac3bn."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Parmalat reported a doubling of profit to \u20ac77m in the fourth quarter, up from \u20ac38m in 2003.", "The company was fined \u20ac11m for violating takeover rules five years ago and has nearly \u20ac12bn in debt, which is slowly falling.", "Its brands continue to perform well despite the scandal.", "Parmalat's administrator is suing several banks, including Morgan Stanley, to recover \u20ac136m from a bond deal, with more legal actions planned."], "gemma2:2b": ["Parmalat's profits doubled in Q4 2008, but the company was fined 11m euros for violating takeover rules and remains heavily indebted with debt of nearly 12bn euros.", "Despite the scandal, Parmalat's brands remain strong, although legal action is ongoing to recover funds from banks, auditors, and former management."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Parmalat reported a doubling in profits in its fourth quarter compared to the same period last year, with pre-tax earnings of 77 million Euros ($100 million).", "Despite facing a \u20ac11 million fine for violating takeover rules five years ago, Parmalat is seeking bankruptcy protection.", "The company's debt levels are around \u20ac12 billion and are falling slowly, although revenue has not been declining since the scandal.", "A major legal action has been filed against Parmalat by its former bankers and lawyers, with a total of 49 banks being sued.", "Additionally, the company is also facing lawsuits from former management for damages and criminal cases."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Parmalat reported doubled profits of 77m euros in Q4, citing fines from a takeover violation but notes its brands continue to perform well despite the scandal.", "The company faces substantial legal challenges with more than 50 lawsuits and potential losses of up to 3bn euros."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Parmalat, facing a significant financial scandal, reported a quadrupling of pre-tax earnings to 77m euros in Q4 from 38m in 2003.", "Despite being fined 11m euros for violating takeover rules and seeking bankruptcy protection in 2003 due to an accounting shortfall, the company's brands continue to perform well.", "However, its financial recovery is hindered by legal battles with banks and auditors over a complex deal from 2003, which could potentially result in damages totaling up to 3bn euros.", "Criminal cases against former management are also ongoing."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Parmalat boasts doubled profits.", "Its pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter were 77m euros (\u00a353m;
