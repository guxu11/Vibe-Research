{"raw_text": "Turkey-Iran mobile deal 'at risk'\n \n Turkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by MPs.\n \n Iran's parliament voted by a large majority to cut Turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%. The move, which was justified on national security grounds, follows an earlier vote by MPs to give themselves a veto over foreign investments. Turkcell said the decision \"increases the risks\" attached to the project. Although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal. \"The possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero,\" said Atinc Ozkan, analyst at Finans Investment in Istanbul. If Turkcell does back out, MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal.\n \n Turkcell's mobile deal is the second Turkish investment in Iran to run into trouble. Turkish-Austrian consortium TAV was chosen to build and run Tehran's new Imam Khomeini International Airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in May 2004. In both cases, the justification has been national security, amid allegations that the Turkish firms are too close to Israel. The hardline posture taken by parliament, which is dominated by religious conservatives, could yet impact other inward investments.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Turkey's mobile firm Turkcell's investment in Iran is set to be scrapped due to a 70% stake being cut from 49%.", "The move was justified on national security grounds, but observers believe it increases the risks attached to the project and may lead to the company pulling out.", "If Turkcell does back out, MTN could take the deal, which is worth $3bn."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Turkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry may be scrapped after MPs slashed Turkcell's stake from 70% to 49% on national security grounds, with observers predicting the company will pull out of the $3bn deal."], "gemma2:2b": ["Turkey's Turkcell investment in Iran's mobile industry faces potential cancellation due to parliament's decision to reduce Turkcell's stake and give itself a veto over foreign investments.", "This move threatens the $3 billion deal and may lead to MTN's re-entry into the competition, while potentially impacting other Turkish investments in Iran."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["A major Turkish investment in Iran's mobile industry has been scrapped after MPs voted to cut Turkcell's stake by 49%.", "This decision was justified on security grounds but could have significant consequences for Turkey's relations with Iran and the international community.", "If Turkcell pulls out of the project, MTN (South African firm) might still be interested in the deal due to its strong support from the US government."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Turkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry faces risk due to MPs slashing Turkcell's stake from 70% to 49%, citing national security and giving themselves veto power over foreign investments.", "If Turkcell pulls out, MTN might take its place.", "This comes after a Turkish-Austrian consortium failed to build Tehran airport.", "The move could impact other inward investments by Turkey due to parliament's hardline stance."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Turkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry appears threatened after Turkcell saw its stake slashed from 70% to 49%.", "This follows a parliamentary vote giving them veto power over foreign investments and concerns about national security.", "Analysts believe Turkcell is likely to abandon the $3bn deal, potentially allowing MTN to re-enter.", "This marks Turkey's second investment in Iran facing national security objections;
