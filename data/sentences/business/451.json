{"raw_text": "Winemaker rejects Foster's offer\n \n Australian winemaker Southcorp has rejected a takeover offer worth 3.1bn Australian dollars ($2.3bn; \u00a31.8bn) from brewing giant Foster's Group.\n \n Southcorp, whose brands include Penfolds, Rosemount and Lindemans, dismissed the offer as inadequate. The two companies held four days of talks after Foster's bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on 13 January. A merger would create a global player with worldwide annual sales of 39m cases and revenues of A$2.6bn.\n \n Southcorp said Foster's A$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a \"excellent strategic fit\" but undervalued the company. \"Southcorp's board has informed Foster's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company,\" said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn.\n \n Southcorp said Foster's takeover offer was \"opportunistic\". However, it said that the offer may represent an 'opening bid', opening up the possibility of Foster's returning with an improved offer.\n \n Foster's said a combination of the two companies would create a global player with an \"unrivalled\" collection of premium wine brands. Despite being best known for brewing Foster's Lager, Foster's is already one of Australia's largest wine producers, owning the Beringer and Wolf Blass brands among others. \"The combination of Foster's and Southcorp will transform the global wine industry and significantly enhance Australia's competitive position on the global stage,\" said Trevor O'Hoy, Foster's chief executive officer. Foster's spent A$584m on buying an 18.8% stake in Southcorp from the Oatley family, which founded the Rosemount Estates business and later merged it into Southcorp. Shares in both companies were suspended while the two held talks about a deal. Southcorp's shares rose 12% to A$4.76 on news of the offer but Foster's shares fell 3.7% to A$5.44.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Australian winemaker Southcorp has rejected a takeover offer from brewing giant Foster's Group worth $2.3bn, which proposed to merge with Southcorp in a global wine industry powerhouse.", "The two companies had four days of talks after Foster's acquired an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on January 13."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Southcorp has rejected a $2.3bn takeover offer from Foster's Group, citing an \"inadequate\" valuation.", "The two companies held talks after Foster's acquired an 18.8% stake in Southcorp for $584m.", "Southcorp said the offer was \"opportunistic\" and may be just an opening bid, leaving room for Foster's to return with a better proposal."], "gemma2:2b": ["Southcorp rejected Foster's takeover offer worth $2.3 billion, citing it as undervaluing the company.", "The offer was deemed \"opportunistic\" by Southcorp and may represent an initial bid for a potential future improved proposal.", "Foster's sees the merger creating a global leader in premium wine brands, with their combined sales expected to be substantial."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Southcorp, an Australian winemaker, rejected Foster's takeover offer of 3.1 billion Australian dollars ($2.3 billion), believing it was \"opportunistic\" and not worth considering.", "Southcorp expressed its board's dissatisfaction with the deal proposal and is reportedly ready to recommend a different acquisition that would better reflect the company's strategic value."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Australian winemaker Southcorp has rejected Foster's Group's takeover offer worth $2.3 billion, citing inadequate valuation.", "Proposed merger would create global wine giant with significant premium brand portfolio."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Australian winemaker Southcorp has rejected a takeover offer from brewing giant Foster's Group worth $2.3bn, citing it as undervalued.", "Southcorp brands include Penfolds, Rosemount and Lindemans.", "The two companies held talks after Foster's bought 18.8% stake in Southcorp.", "A merger would have created a global player with worldwide sales of 39m cases and revenues of $2.6bn.", "Southcorp rejected the offer as opportunistic but said it may represent an opening bid, potentially leading to further negotiations.", "Foster's sees potential in creating a global wine player through this combination."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Australian winemaker Southcorp has rejected a takeover offer from brewing giant Foster's Group.", "The two companies held four days of talks, and a merger would create a global player with an annual sales of 39m cases and revenues of approximately $2.6bn.", "After hearing from the board of Southcorp, it informed Foster's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer for strategic reasons.", "However, it made an 'opening bid' for a new opportunity.", "The combination of Foster's and Southcorp has transformed Australia's wine industry and significantly enhanced Australia's competitive position on global stage.", "Foster's spent approximately $584m on buying the stake in Southcorp from the Oatley family."], "smollm:1.7b": ["The summary is concise and preserves key ideas, including:\n\n1.", "The rejection of a takeover offer by an Australian winery.", "2.", "The valuation of the company by a global player.", "3.", "The strategic fit between the two companies.", "4.", "The opportunity for growth through a merger.", "5.", "The value proposition of the combined entity."], "deepseek-r1:1.5b": ["Southcorp rejected a takeover offer from Foster's Group worth approximately $3.1 billion.", "The merger was scheduled to create a global company with 39 million cases and $2.6 million in revenue, but Southcorp dismissed the offer as inadequate.", "Foster's's proposal was seen as strategic fit but undervalued.", "Foster's spent $584 million on a 18.8% stake and has several premium brands.", "Shares of South Corp rose to $4.76, while Foster's fell to $5.44 after the news."], "tinyllama:1.1b": ["Winemaaker Southcorp rebuffed Fooster's takeover offer for a 31 billion Australian dollars ($2.3bn;
