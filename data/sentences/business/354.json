{"raw_text": "Asia shares defy post-quake gloom\n \n Thailand has become the first of the 10 southern Asian nations battered by giant waves at the weekend to cut its economic forecast.\n \n Thailand's economy is now expected to grow by 5.7% in 2005, rather than 6% as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces. The full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. But Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs on Wednesday, suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact.\n \n The highs showed the gap in outlook between investors in large firms and individuals who have lost their livelihoods.\n \n Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas - such as Aceh in Indonesia - were so under-developed that the tragedy would little impact on Asia's listed companies, according to analysts. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing. But it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense,\" said ABN Amro chief Asian strategist Eddie Wong. India's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\n \n Thailand may lose 30bn baht (\u00a3398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\n \n In the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage. However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Thailand's economy is expected to grow by 5.7% in 2005, rather than 6%, due to post-tsunami reconstruction spending.", "Stock markets in Indonesia, India, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka have reached record highs despite investors' concerns about the potential economic impact.", "Tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome estimates Thailand will lose 30bn baht (\u00a3398m; $768m) in tourism revenue over three months.", "The government plans to spend a similar amount on rebuilding work."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Thailand cuts economic forecast due to tsunami effects.", "Investors show optimism despite high loss of life in underdeveloped areas like Indonesia's Aceh.", "India, Hong Kong, and Indonesian stock markets reach record highs.", "Thailand expects to lose 30bn baht from tourism revenue over three months but plans to spend same amount on reconstruction.", "Maldives fears economic cost could wipe out GDP."], "gemma2:2b": ["Thailand revised its economic growth forecast due to the tsunamis' effect on tourism.", "Investor confidence remains high despite a potential economic loss in some areas like Indonesia and Sri Lanka.", "The Maldives may lose considerable GDP from the disaster, but reconstruction spending could offset those losses.", "Many experts remain cautious about assessing the full economic impact of the disaster."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["The Asian economies are facing severe losses after large-scale earthquakes in several southern countries.", "Thailand, in particular, has been hit hard by an 18-meter tsunami on Saturday, leading to a 5.7% drop in economic forecasts compared with the same period last year.", "The full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear and investors appear more concerned about the worst-affected areas than those who have lost their livelihoods.", "Thailand's stock market has reached record highs, suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact.", "Sontaya Kunplome, Thailand's tourism minister, estimates that it could take until 2014 to fully recover from the damage caused by the tsunami.", "The Maldives' economy has been estimated at $660m, and investment in a single tourist resort could run to $40m between 10 and 12 resorts damaged."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Thailand's economy forecast lowered by 0.3 percentage points following tsunami.", "Thailand expected to spend over $1 billion on rebuilding.", "Southeast Asian markets rise due to optimism about recovery from natural disasters.", "Sri Lanka, Maldives see significant economic losses estimated in billions of dollars.", "Experts warn it's challenging to accurately assess the full impact of tsunami-related damages."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Asia's stock markets reached record highs despite Thailand cutting its economic forecast due to tsunamis hitting six tourist provinces.", "Thailand expects a 5.7% growth in GDP for 2005, down from initially projected 6%.", "In contrast, the Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets surged on investor optimism that companies will not be significantly impacted by underdeveloped regions like Aceh.", "However, losses are expected elsewhere; Sri Lanka could lose up to 1% of its annual growth.", "Thailand anticipates a three-month loss of around 30bn baht in tourism earnings, which will be partly offset by government spending on reconstruction.", "In the Maldives, where GDP is $660m, reconstruction costs could surpass this figure."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["The text provided summarizes the following key points:\n\n1.", "Asia shares defy post-quake gloom -
