{"raw_text": "ID theft surge hits US consumers\n \n Almost a quarter of a million US consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004, official figures suggest.\n \n The Federal Trade Commission said two in five of the 635,173 reports it had from consumers concerned ID fraud. ID theft occurs when criminals use someone else's personal information to steal credit or commit other crimes. Internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints, comprising 16% of the total. The total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (\u00a3290m).\n \n The report marks the fifth year in a row in which identity fraud has topped the table. The biggest slice of the 246,570 ID fraud cases reported - almost 30% - concerned abuses of people's credit. Misusing someone's identity to claim new credit cards or loans comprised 16.5% of the total, with almost 12% coming from false claims on existing credit. Another 18% came from attempts to rip off people's bank accounts, while 13% of cases concerned attempts to defraud employers by abusing someone else's identity. Outside the field of ID theft, 53% of the near-400,000 complaints were internet-related. Among the 100,000 internet auction complaints, the failure of sellers to deliver or the supply of sub-standard goods were the most common woes reported. Catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line, accounting for 8% of total complaints, while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people's PCs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to 6% of complaints.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Almost 250,000 US consumers reported identity theft in 2004, with two in five reports involving online auctions, followed by credit fraud cases totaling $546m (\u00a3290m) in cost."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Almost a quarter of a million US consumers reported being targeted for identity theft in 2004, with the total cost of fraud at $546m.", "Internet auctions were the second biggest source of complaints, accounting for 16% of cases.", "Identity abuse via credit accounts was the most common type of ID fraud, making up almost 30% of cases."], "gemma2:2b": ["246,570 US consumers reported being victims of identity theft in 2004, with the cost reaching $546 million.", "The majority of cases (30%) involved abuse of credit.", "Internet auctions were second most-reported source of fraud, while internet sales and computer issues also accounted for a significant number of complaints."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports that two out of every five US consumers reported being targeted for identity theft in 2004, amounting to almost a quarter of a million cases.", "The report notes that ID fraud is the second most common type of fraud among the general population after credit card fraud, with approximately 16% of online complaints related to it.", "Misusing someone's personal information to obtain new credit or loans was reported by two out of every five consumers involved in this activity.", "Credit card fraud accounts for about 30% of ID fraud cases involving credit cards, followed by false claims on existing credit (12%), attempts to rip off people's bank accounts (18%), and attempts to defraud employers by abusing someone else's identity (16%).", "ID theft encompasses a wide range of fraudulent activities, including online auctions, the failure of sellers to deliver goods, catalog and home-shopping frauds, spyware found on people's PCs, undisclosed charges for websites, computer software piracy, and other internet-related issues.", "Internet auction complaints accounted for 8% of total ID fraud cases reported by consumers."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["ID theft surged by a quarter million cases, affecting nearly a fifth of US consumers who reported identity fraud in 2004.", "The FTC received reports from over 635,000 individuals.", "Internet auctions were the second-largest source of fraud complaints.", "Credit abuse and false claims on existing credit topped ID fraud statistics at 30% each.", "ID theft costs $546 million or \u00a3290 million in total reported by consumers.", "The report marks the fifth consecutive year with identity fraud being the most complained-about issue."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["ID theft surge hits US consumers: In 2004, nearly 250,000 US consumers reported being targeted by identity thieves, with ID fraud reports topping five years in a row.", "Two out of every five consumer complaints (16%) were related to internet auctions.", "Total cost was $546m (\u00a3290m).", "Major areas affected: misuse of credit (30%), false claims on existing credit (12%), bank account abuse (18%), and employer fraud attempts (13%).", "Outside ID theft, nearly half (53%) of 378,000 complaints were internet-related.", "Common issues: sellers failing to deliver or providing substandard goods (internet auctions), fraudulent catalogues and home shopping scams (8% each), and concerns about internet services/PC spyware/disclosed charges for websites (6%)."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["\"ID theft surge hits US consumers nearly a quarter of million Americans complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004.", "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported two in five fraudulent reports from consumers concerned with ID fraud.", "Internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints comprising 16% of total.", "The cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546 million and $290 million respectively (\u00a3290 million).", "The report marks the fifth year in a row where identity fraud has topped the table, contributing almost 30% to concerned abuses of people's credit.", "Misusing someone's identity to claim new credit cards or loans accounted for 16.5% of total, with about 12% coming from false claims on existing credit and another 18% occurred from fraudulent employment attempts, while employers were also concerned with defraud attempts.\""], "smollm:1.7b": ["The summary is concise and clear, preserving the key ideas and details from the original text.", "The main points are:\n\n1.", "Almost a quarter of a million US consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004.", "2.", "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said two in five of the 635,173 reports it had from consumers concerned ID fraud.", "3.", "The total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546 million (\u00a3290 million).", "4.", "The biggest slice of the 246,570 ID fraud cases -
