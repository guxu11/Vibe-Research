{"raw_text": "Chinese dam firm 'defies Beijing'\n \n The China Three Gorges Project Corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the Chinese state press has said.\n \n The builder of the Three Gorges Dam is continuing work on the sister Xiluodu dam, said the Beijing News. The Xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The Beijing News said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and the Three Gorges Project Electrical Power Supply Plant.\n \n So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by China's State Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order. The China Three Gorges Project Corp could now face a fine up to 200,000 yuan ($24,000; \u00a312,700). Last week, it denied that its projects violated regulations. \"The Three Gorges Corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law,\" it said.\n \n The Sepa order comes as the Chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country's booming economy. Previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages, which forced many factories into part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6% to 440,700 megawatts (MW). The Xiluodu Dam is designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity, and is being built on the Jinshajiang - or \"river of golden sand\" as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. It is a sister project to the main Three Gorges Dam downstream where more than half a million people have had to be relocated, drawing criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["China's state-owned firm China Three Gorges Project Corp has refused to stop construction of its dam despite an order by the government to halt work due to lack of proper environmental checks.", "The company continues construction on Xiluodu Dam and three other projects, including a power plant and a power supply plant, which have received warnings from the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)."], "llama3.2:3b": ["The China Three Gorges Project Corp is refusing to stop construction of its Xiluodu dam despite a government order to do so.", "The company may choose to pay a fine instead, while ignoring orders at two other projects.", "Only 22 of 30 construction projects targeted by the State Environmental Protection Agency have complied with the shutdown order, and the firm could face a fine up to $24,000."], "gemma2:2b": ["The China Three Gorges Project Corp is ignoring government orders to halt construction on its Xiluodu dam due to lack of proper environmental impact assessments.", "Despite facing potential fines, the company is continuing work on the project.", "Only a small number of projects targeted for environmental violations have complied with the shutdown order."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["China's three major dam projects are being halted due to an order that forbids construction of one of its dams."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["China Three Gorges Project Corp refuses orders to halt construction of its dams due to failure in complying with mandatory environmental checks, potentially facing fines totaling $24,000.", "The firm is ignoring instructions for 30 large-scale projects related to this issue, including Xiluodu Dam and two others."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Chinese dam firm China Three Gorges Project Corp continues construction on Xiluodu dam despite government order to halt work due to improper environmental checks.", "Only 22 out of 30 targeted projects have complied with Sepa's shutdown order.", "The company may face a fine up to 200,000 yuan ($24,000).", "This decision comes as China tries to cool its economy and has previously encouraged construction for energy shortages.", "Xiluodu dam is designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity on Jinshajiang river, a sister project to the controversial Three Gorges Dam downstream where forced relocation of half a million people occurred."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["China's dam firm 'defies Beijing' insists on stopping large-scale construction projects like the Three Gorges Dam while simultaneously imposing strict fines.", "The firm has been told by Beijing News that it would rather take a fine than stop the construction of Xiluodu dam due to lack of environmental checks.", "Meanwhile, the company ignores orders to halt the construction of the Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and the Electrical Power Supply Plant -
