{"raw_text": "EU 'too slow' on economic reforms\n \n Most EU countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade, a report says.\n \n The study, undertaken by the European Commission, sought to assess how far the EU has moved towards meeting its economic targets. In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010. Their economic targets became known as the Lisbon Agenda. But the Commission report says that, in most EU countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow, and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.\n \n Only the UK, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations. Among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are Greece and Italy. The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce. It also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development, while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU, the plan was for Europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 2010. Next week, the Commission will present revised proposals to meet the Lisbon goals. Many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Most EU countries have failed to implement economic reforms aimed at making Europe competitive.", "The European Commission report found that the pace of reform has been too slow in most countries and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult.", "Greece and Italy are among the biggest laggards, with only a few countries, including the UK, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and the Netherlands following up policy recommendations."], "llama3.2:3b": ["EU countries have failed to implement economic reforms aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by 2010, a report by the European Commission says.", "Only six countries have followed policy recommendations, with Greece and Italy among the biggest laggards.", "The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase workforce participation, boost research and development, and reduce public debt, but many experts expect the 2010 target to be dropped."], "gemma2:2b": ["EU countries have failed to implement economic reforms necessary for becoming a world-leading competitive economy by the end of the decade.", "The EU's 2000 \"Lisbon Agenda\" aimed to surpass US economic strength and achieve this goal, but many countries are lagging behind in implementing necessary policies.", "Only a few EU nations have followed recommendations, while others like Greece and Italy fall behind.", "The Lisbon Agenda focused on workforce participation, private sector R&D spending, public spending control, environmental standards, and business competition within the EU to boost European economic growth.", "The original 2010 target is likely to be abandoned."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["The European Union is too slow in implementing economic reforms to meet its ambitious goals of becoming the world's most competitive economy by 2010.", "The report suggests that only a few EU countries have moved forward with their economic policies, while other countries lag behind due to issues like high levels of unemployment and insufficient public spending."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["The European Union has failed to achieve its economic reform targets set in 2000, and it is unlikely to reach the Lisbon Agenda's ambitious goal of making Europe the world's most competitive economy by 2010.", "Only a few countries have implemented policy recommendations, while Greece and Italy are major laggards.", "The EU plans for more employed people, increased private sector R&D spending, disciplined public finances, and environmental standards to make Europe dynamic."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["EU 'too slow' on economic reforms: Most EU countries have failed to implement policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by 2010, despite initial pledges in the Lisbon Agenda.", "Only a few member states like UK, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands followed recommendations.", "Greece and Italy are major laggards.", "The agenda aimed to boost employment, R&D spending, fiscal discipline, environmental standards and business equality by 2010, but many EU countries have not met these targets, prompting revised proposals for meeting Lisbon goals, with some expecting a shift in emphasizing 2010 target."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["The European Union (EU) report on 'too slow' economic reform in the last decade highlights countries that are still struggling with reaching their stated economic targets.", "Despite attempts by many leaders, the pace of reform is not always swift.", "While countries like the UK, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Netherlands have shown consistent progress in addressing these issues, some of them might face similar challenges once the goals are achieved.", "However, the Commission's revised proposals, aimed at increasing employment, raising funds for research and development, increased public spending and discipline prevention, leveling the playing field among businesses and environmental regulations could potentially make Europe more competitive by 2020."], "smollm:1.7b": ["The EU has failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade, according to a report.", "The study assesses how far the EU has moved towards meeting its economic targets set out in 2000.", "In 2000, EU leaders promised to make Europe the world's most competitive economy by 2010.", "Their economic targets became known as the Lisbon Agenda.", "But the Commission report says that, in most EU countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult -
