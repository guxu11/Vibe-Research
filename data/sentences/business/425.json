{"raw_text": "Nortel in $300m profit revision\n \n Telecoms equipment maker Nortel Networks has sharply revised downwards its profits for the 2003 fiscal year.\n \n In a long-awaited filing, Nortel said it had made $434m (\u00a3231m), compared to the previously reported $732m. But the figures - revised after an audit which led to the sacking of the Canadian firm's chief - showed revenue was about 4% higher than first thought. Nortel shares, which have lost nearly 50% of their value since last year, climbed 1.46% in Toronto on Tuesday. Nortel's head Frank Dunn and two other executives were fired in January last year after the company announced it had conducted the internal audit. Securities and police authorities in both the US and Canada are still conducting inquiries into the accounts.\n \n Nortel also issued new figures for the 2001-2002 period, which they had previously indicated had understated losses. \"With the completion of our restatements we have a solid foundation on which to move forward with our business,\" said Nortel president and chief executive Bill Owens. \"The restatement has been a monumental task, both complex and demanding.\" The company also said 12 senior executives - none of whom were involved directly in the accounting of the revised figures - have voluntarily agreed to repay to bonuses awarded in 2003 totalling $8.6m. Nortel added: \"these members of the core executive team share the board's deep disappointment over the circumstances that led to the restatement.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Nortel Networks has made $434m
