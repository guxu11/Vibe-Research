{"raw_text": "Nasdaq planning $100m share sale\n \n The owner of the technology-dominated Nasdaq stock index plans to sell shares to the public and list itself on the market it operates.\n \n According to a registration document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq Stock Market plans to raise $100m (\u00a352m) from the sale. Some observers see this as another step closer to a full public listing. However Nasdaq, an icon of the 1990s technology boom, recently poured cold water on those suggestions.\n \n The company first sold shares in private placements during 2000 and 2001. It technically went public in 2002 when the stock started trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, which lists equities that trade only occasionally. Nasdaq will not make money from the sale, only investors who bought shares in the private placings, the filing documents said. The Nasdaq is made up shares in technology firms and other companies with high growth potential. It was the most potent symbol of the 1990s internet and telecoms boom, nose-diving after the bubble burst. A recovery in the fortunes of tech giants such as Intel, and dot.com survivors such as Amazon has helped revive its fortunes.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Nasdaq plans to raise $100m from a public share sale
