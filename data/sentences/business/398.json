{"raw_text": "Tsunami to cost Sri Lanka $1.3bn\n \n Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn (\u00a3691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30,000 of its people, its central bank says.\n \n This estimate is preliminary, bank governor Sunil Mendis told reporters, and could rise in 2006. The island state is asking for about $320m from the International Monetary Fund to help pay for relief, he said. The bank has 5bn rupees ($50m; \u00a327m) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property. According to Mr Mendis, half the IMF support could come from a freeze on debt repayments, which would free up resources immediately. The rest could come from a five-year emergency loan. Sri Lanka is hoping for a wider freeze from other creditors.\n \n The Paris Club of 19 creditors meets on 12 January to discuss a debt moratorium for the nations hit by the tsunami, which ravaged south and east Asia on 26 December.\n \n Some 150,000 people across the region are feared to be dead and millions have been left homeless and destitute. A full reckoning of the economic cost to Sri Lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come. But already it looks likely that growth in the first half of 2005 will slow, Mr Mendis told reporters, although he would not say by how much. One side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country. The currency has strengthened 4% since late December, coming close to 100 rupees to the US dollar for the first time in more than six months.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Sri Lanka faces a $1.3 billion reconstruction bill after a tsunami that killed over 30,000 people in 2005.", "The central bank is seeking IMF assistance of about $320m, with half potentially coming from debt freeze or emergency loan.", "A Paris Club meeting will discuss a debt moratorium for affected nations."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn bill from the central bank for tsunami reconstruction and is asking the IMF for $320m.", "The island state is also seeking debt relief from creditors, including a freeze on repayments and a five-year emergency loan.", "A Paris Club meeting on January 12 will discuss a debt moratorium for nations affected by the tsunami, which killed over 30,000 people and left millions homeless."], "gemma2:2b": ["Sri Lanka faces a $1.3 billion reconstruction cost after the tsunami.", "The central bank estimates this could rise and is seeking $320 million from the International Monetary Fund to help pay for relief.", "Half of that support could come from debt moratoriums, freeing up immediate resources.", "The country is also hoping for wider debt freezes from other creditors."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["The Sri Lanka government is seeking $320m from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a preliminary estimate of the tsunami's reconstruction costs.", "The bank has set aside 5bn rupees (GBP 27m) to lend at a lower interest rate, and half of the IMF's support could come from a freeze on debt repayments.", "Sri Lanka hopes for a wider freeze from other creditors.", "While the exact cost is not clear yet, some economists predict growth in the first half of 2005 will slow due to the impact of the disaster."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn reconstruction cost after the tsunami in 2005, with an IMF freeze on debt repayments providing immediate resources.", "The island nation is requesting about $320m from the International Monetary Fund and has set aside \u20b95bn ($50m;
