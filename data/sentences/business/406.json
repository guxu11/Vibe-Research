{"raw_text": "Mixed Christmas for US retailers\n \n US retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers faring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales.\n \n Upscale department store Nordstrom said same store sales were 9.3% higher than during the same period last year. Trendy youth labels also sold well, with sales jumping 28% at young women's clothing retailer Bebe Stores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. But Wal-Mart only saw its sales rise after it cut prices. The company saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier.\n \n Customers at the world's biggest retailer are generally seen to be the most vulnerable to America's economic woes.\n \n Commentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over job security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in spending in the face of higher gasoline prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart faced a \"stand-off\" with shoppers, stepping up its discounts as the festive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best bargains. However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across the sector, Christmas sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual retail sales - would have been far worse. \"So far, we are faring better than expected, but the results are still split,\" Ken Perkins, an analyst at research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. \"Stores that have been struggling over the last couple of months appear to be continuing that trend. And for stores that have been doing well over the last several months, December was a good month.\" Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen a year earlier.\n \n One discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, which continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-expected 8% jump in same store sales. However, the losers were many and varied. Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports saw its same store sales sink by a larger-than-forecast 8.8% as it battled fierce competition. Leading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed its sales target of a 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the Christmas period. Accessory vendor Claire's Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Jeweller Zale also felt little Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year. \"This was not a good period for retailers or shoppers. We saw a dearth of exciting, new items,\" Kurt Barnard, president of industry forecaster Retail Consulting Group, said. However, one beneficiary of the desertion of the High Street is expected to be online stores. According to a survey by Goldman Sachs & Co, Harris Interactive and Neilsen/Net Ratings sales surged 25% over the holiday season to $23.2bn.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["US retailers posted mixed results for December with luxury retailers doing well while others struggled due to price cuts.", "Nordstrom saw an 9.3% increase in same-store sales, Bebe and American Eagle Outfitters also showed a strong performance.", "Wal-Mart increased its sales by 3%, less than the year before.", "Customers are vulnerable to economic woes but tend to cut back on spending during uncertain times.", "Retailers faced challenges due to lower gasoline prices and uncertainty over job security for some customers.", "The Christmas season saw nearly 23% of annual retail sales, with Wal-Mart's forecasted rise at 4.5%."], "llama3.2:3b": ["US retailers had mixed results in December with luxury retailers performing well but many others cutting prices.", "Nordstrom saw 9.3% higher same-store sales while Bebe Stores and American Eagle Outfitters jumped by 28% and 32.2%, respectively.", "Walmart's sales rose only after it cut prices, while customers at the company faced an \"economic woes\" led to reduced spending.", "Costco Wholesale saw a 8% jump in same-store sales, but many retailers, including Best Buy and Pier 1 Imports, missed their sales targets.", "Online stores benefited from the decline of brick-and-mortar retailers, with sales surging by 25%."], "gemma2:2b": ["US retailers had mixed results for December, with luxury retailers performing well while many others had to cut prices to boost sales.", "Wal-Mart saw a 3% rise in sales after price cuts, while upscale stores like Nordstrom and Bebe Stores experienced significant gains.", "However, many other retailers, including Pier 1 Imports, Best Buy, and Claire's, struggled with declining sales.", "Costco Wholesale showed strong results, and online shopping experienced a surge in sales during the holiday season.", "Overall, December sales are projected to rise but remain below last year's performance."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Here's a summary of the text:\n\n- US retailers posted mixed results for December, with some improving (e.g., Nordstrom), while others saw sales decline.", "- Upscale department store Nordstrom reported an upward trend in sales.", "- Trendy youth labels had a good month, seeing sales increase at Bebe Stores and American Eagle Outfitters.", "- Wal-Mart faced a stand-off from customers, reducing prices as the holiday season approached.", "Sales rose 3% compared to a year earlier.", "- Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5%, down 2.8% year-over-year in the UK but up 10.7% in America."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["US retailers experienced mixed Christmas results: luxury brands like Nordstrom posted strong growth while many others saw declines due to low sales and price cuts by Walmart.", "High-end electronics chain Best Buy missed its goal, while other stores struggled as consumers shopped online instead of in physical malls.", "Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5%, less than a year earlier."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["US retailers reported mixed results for December, with luxury brands doing well while many others struggled due to price cuts.", "Nordstrom saw a strong 9.3% increase in same-store sales, and Bebe Stores also experienced significant growth at young women's clothing stores.", "American Eagle Outfitters followed suit with a 32.2% jump.", "In contrast, Walmart only managed a 3% rise, largely due to cutting prices.", "Analysts noted that many shoppers cut back on spending amid economic uncertainty, leading to more discounts from retailers like Wal-Mart.", "Costco Wholesale performed well at 8%, while Pier 1 Imports saw a larger-than-expected decline of 8.8%.", "Best Buy and Claire's Stores also struggled with sales growth below expectations.", "Zale reported a slight drop in sales, attributing it to no significant last-minute shopping rush.", "The holiday season still provided some financial benefit for online stores, as indicated by a 25% increase in sales from the survey of Goldman Sachs & Co, Harris Interactive, and Nielsen/Net Ratings."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["\"Mixed Christmas for US retailers -
