{"raw_text": "Enron bosses in $168m payout\n \n Eighteen former Enron directors have agreed a $168m (\u00a389m) settlement deal in a shareholder lawsuit over the collapse of the energy firm.\n \n Leading plaintiff, the University of California, announced the news, adding that 10 of the former directors will pay $13m from their own pockets. The settlement will be put to the courts for approval next week. Enron went bankrupt in 2001 after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.\n \n Before its collapse, the firm was the seventh biggest public US company by revenue. Its demise sent shockwaves through financial markets and dented investor confidence in corporate America.\n \n \"The settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible,\" William Lerach, the lawyer leading the class action suit against Enron, said. \"Hopefully, this will help send a message to corporate boardrooms of the importance of directors performing their legal duties,\" he added. Under the terms of the $168m settlement - $155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. The deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of Enron's shareholders almost three years ago. So far, including the latest deal, just under $500m (\u00a3378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.\n \n However, the latest deal does not include former Enron chief executives Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling. Both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm's collapse. Neither does it cover Andrew Fastow, who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. Enron's shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston. The University of California said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in October 2006. It joined the lawsuit in December 2001alleging \"massive insider trading\" and fraud, claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Eighteen former Enron directors have agreed a $168m settlement deal over the collapse of the energy firm.", "The University of California is seeking damages for \"massive insider trading\" and fraud.", "The directors will pay $13m from their own pockets, with 10 paying an additional $1.3m each.", "The settlement covers $155m through insurance, leaving out executives Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andrew Fastow, and others facing criminal charges."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Eighteen former Enron directors agree to a $168m settlement with investors, with 10 paying $13m from their own pockets, over allegations of massive insider trading and fraud.", "The settlement does not include former executives Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling or Andrew Fastow, who has pleaded guilty."], "gemma2:2b": ["Eighteen former Enron directors agreed to a $168 million settlement for their role in the company's collapse.", "They will not admit wrongdoing but the settlement is significant because it holds them partially responsible and sends a message about director accountability.", "So far, over $500 million has been recovered for investors through various settlements.", "However, this deal doesn't cover former CEO Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, or Andrew Fastow who are facing criminal charges.", "The shareholder lawsuit is still ongoing with the trial scheduled to begin in October 2006."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Here's a summary of the text:\n\nEighteen former Enron directors have reached a $168 million settlement deal with the university, agreeing to pay an additional $13 million from their own pockets after they were plaintiffs in a shareholder lawsuit over the firm's financial collapse in 2001.", "The deal is expected to go into court next week and may help send a message to corporate boardrooms about the importance of directors performing their legal duties.", "Former Enron CEO Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andrew Fastow, and others are still seeking damages from major defendants like JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and Credit Suisse First Boston."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Eighteen former Enron directors have agreed a $168 million settlement over shareholder lawsuits related to the energy firm's collapse, including an out-of-pocket payment of $13 million by 10 of the directors.", "The deal is part of a larger class action suit against Enron that has recovered nearly $500 million for investors since its inception in 2003."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Eighteen former Enron directors have agreed a $168 million settlement deal to settle shareholder lawsuits over the firm's collapse.", "The University of California led the lawsuit;
