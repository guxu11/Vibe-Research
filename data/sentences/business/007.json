{"raw_text": "Jobs growth still slow in the US\n \n The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\n \n According to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\n \n The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\n \n Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. \"We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["US jobs growth in January was 146,000, down from expectations and below market projections of 190,000.", "The unemployment rate dropped to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001, despite only minor job gains.", "President Bush's administration has enjoyed a net fall in jobs up to November's election, but now sees a positive jobs record for the first term with added December and January numbers.", "Analysts believe moderate job growth is being hindered by low interest rates and a low-value dollar, limiting new employment opportunities."], "llama3.2:3b": ["US firms added 146,000 jobs in January, below market expectations of 190,000, but pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years at 5.2%.", "The administration's first term record ended positive despite previous job losses.", "Analysts say the growth was moderate and not as strong as expected, suggesting a limited number of new opportunities for workers."], "gemma2:2b": ["US firms added 146,000 jobs in January, below expectations and leading to a 5.2% unemployment rate, its lowest level since 2001.", "This marks President Bush's first term ending with a net job growth, a significant shift from previous presidential election cycles.", "Despite positive trends, analysts suggest job growth is moderate and limited."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["The US economy created fewer jobs than expected in January and the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since September 2001, but job seekers decreased, resulting in slower growth.", "Analysts believe that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Job growth in January was below expectations at 146,000, leading to the lowest unemployment rate since September 2001.", "Despite slow job creation, Bush's first term record shows net positive growth for jobs.", "The labor department also revised down December and January's figures, suggesting slower job growth compared to expected conditions."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Jobs growth in US remains slow in January, with 146,000 jobs created.", "Unemployment rate fell to 5.2%, its lowest since 2001, driven by fewer jobseekers rather than stronger hiring.", "Despite positive net job creation over Bush's term, analysts view current growth as moderate and insufficient given economic conditions.", "December figures were revised downward from 157k to 133k jobs added."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["\"The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\"", "The unemployment rate was falling as predicted due to job creation in January.", "According to the Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs while the gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs.", "The unemployment rate dropped by 5.2% since September 2001, marking a notable shift in the economy's labor force status.", "The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate -
