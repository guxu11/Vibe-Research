{"raw_text": "US economy shows solid GDP growth\n \n The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\n \n The gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\n \n The new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["The US economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004, exceeding expectations and leading to a rise in GDP.", "The value of goods and services produced by the country increased by 3.1%, topping forecasts and surpassing 3.5% growth previously predicted."], "llama3.2:3b": ["US economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.8% in Q4 2004, beating government estimates and previous forecasts.", "GDP growth for the year was 4.4%, the best in five years.", "Businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18% and consumer spending grew 4.2%."], "gemma2:2b": ["The US economy grew at a rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.", "GDP growth exceeded expectations and was driven by business investment and smaller trade deficits.", "Economic growth is expected to continue with an anticipated rate of around 4% for the upcoming first quarter.", "This positive economic climate may lead to higher interest rates."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["The US economy showed a solid GDP growth of 3.8% for the first three quarters of 2004.", "In the fourth quarter, it expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, with businesses spending more on capital equipment and software as a result.", "While economists have predicted interest rates would rise by 1.5 percentage points in March, consumers are planning on saving up for the final quarter of 2004."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.8% in Q4 2004, exceeding expectations and leading to higher interest rates on March 22nd.", "GDP figures show strong business investment growth but slowed consumer spending."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["US economy shows solid GDP growth with an annual rate of 3.8% in Q4 2004, ahead of expectations and forecast.", "Stronger business investment and smaller trade deficit contributed to this increase.", "The new GDP figure topped forecasts at 3.5%, reflecting the best economic performance in five years.", "This growth may lead to interest rate hikes, with a forecasted growth rate of about 4% for Q1-Q3 2005.
