{"raw_text": "US industrial output growth eases\n \n US industrial production continued to rise in November, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month.\n \n The US Federal Reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3% - in line with forecasts - from a revised 0.6% increase in October. Analysts added that if the carmaking sector - which saw production fall 0.5% - had been excluded the data would have been more impressive. The latest increase means industrial output has grown 4.2% in the past year. Many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the US economy, with the increase in production coming on the heels of news of a recovery in retail sales. \"This is very consistent with an economy growing at 3.5 to 4.0%. It is congruent with job growth and consumer optimism,\" Comerica chief economist David Littman said of the figures.\n \n The US economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 3.7% in the three months between July and September, while jobs growth averaged 178,000 during the same period. While the employment figures are not spectacular, experts believe they are enough to whittle away at America's 5.4% jobless rate. A breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output drove the increase, surging 2.1%, while factory output rose 0.3%. But utility output dropped 1.4%. Meanwhile, the amount of factory capacity in use during the month rose to 77.6% - its highest level since May 2001. \"Many investors think that product market inflation won't be a problem until the utilisation rates are at 80% or higher,\" Cary Leahy, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said. \"So there is still a lot of inflation-fighting slack in the manufacturing sector,\" \"Overall I'd say manufacturing at least away from autos continues to improve and I would bet that it improves at a faster rate in coming months given how lean inventories are,\" Citigroup senior economist Steven Wieting added.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["US industrial production increased 0.3% in November, rising from a revised 0.6% increase in October.", "This is the fourth month of growth in US industrial output, with an annual growth rate of 4.2%.", "The data is consistent with an economy growing at 3.5-4.0%, and experts believe it will lead to job growth and consumer optimism."], "llama3.2:3b": ["US industrial production rose 0.3% in November, with mining output surging 2.1%.", "The annual growth rate is 4.2%, and many analysts believe the US economy is growing at a rate of 3.5-4.0%.", "Factory capacity utilization reached its highest level since May 2001, at 77.6%."], "gemma2:2b": ["US industrial production increased 0.3% in November, after a 0.6% increase in October.", "The increase was driven by mining output, which rose 2.1%, and factory output, which rose 0.3%.", "While the overall growth rate is strong, some analysts note that excluding car production shows a more impressive result.", "The US economy grew at 3.7% in the third quarter of 2023."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["US industrial output growth eases, data shows growth of 4.2% in the past year compared to 3.7% three months earlier.", "Mining and utility sectors showed positive growth while factories saw a decrease in output.", "This is consistent with an economy growing at 3.5-4%, job growth, and consumer optimism.", "Manufacturing continues to improve but there are still inflation concerns due to lean inventories."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["US industrial output growth slowed compared to October, with factories and utilities seeing modest increases but the automotive sector shrinking by 0.5%.", "Despite some slowdowns, overall production remains strong, with a year-over-year increase of 4.2% and expectations for continued positive economic indicators due to recent retail sales recovery."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["US industrial production grew 0.3% in November, aligning with forecasts but below the 0.6% increase in October.", "Excluding car manufacturing, which fell by 0.5%, the growth would have been stronger.", "Over the past year, it has grown 4.2%.", "The economy is expected to grow at a rate of 3.5-4.0% annually.", "Mining output drove up overall production with a 2.1% rise and factory output increased by 0.3%, while utility output decreased by 1.4%.", "Factory capacity utilization reached its highest level since May 2001 at 77.6%.", "Analysts predict manufacturing improvement will continue, especially given the low inventory levels."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["The US industrial production continued to rise in November, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month.", "The US Federal Reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3% -
