{"raw_text": "China now top trader with Japan\n \n China overtook the US to become Japan's biggest trading partner in 2004, according to numbers released by Japan's Finance Ministry on Wednesday.\n \n China accounted for 20.1% of Japan's trade in 2004, compared with 18.6% for the US. In 2003, the US was ahead with 20.5% and China came second with 19.2%. The change highlights China's growing importance as an economic powerhouse. In 2004, Japan's imports from and exports to China (and Hong Kong) added up to 22,201bn yen ($214.6bn;\u00a3114.5bn). This is the highest figure for Japanese trade with China since records began in 1947. It compares with 20,479.5bn yen in trade with the US.\n \n Trade with the US during 2004 was hurt by one-off factors, including a 13-month ban on US beef imports following the discovery of a cow infected with mad cow disease (BSE) in the US. However, economists predict China will become an even more important Japanese trading partner in the coming years. On Tuesday, figures showed China's economy grew by 9.5% in 2004 and experts say the overall growth picture remains strong. Analysts see two spurs to future growth as being China's membership of the World Trade Organisation and lower trade tariffs. During 2004, Japan's trade surplus grew 17.9% to 12.011 trillion yen, with more than half the surplus, 6.962 trillion yen, accounted for by its trade with the US. In December, the surplus grew 1.8% on a year ago to 1.14 trillion yen thanks to stronger-than-expected exports.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["China surpassed Japan as Japan's top trading partner in 2004, accounting for 20.1% of Japan's trade that year.", "China's trade with Japan increased by 22.201 billion yen ($214.6 billion) to 22.201 billion yen in 2004, the highest figure since records began in 1947.", "This represents an increase of over 19 billion yen from 2003, as China continues to grow in importance as a trading partner."], "llama3.2:3b": ["China overtook the US as Japan's biggest trading partner in 2004, accounting for 20.1% of Japan's trade.", "China's trade with Japan increased by $214.6 billion in 2004, its highest figure since records began in 1947.", "Economists predict China will become an even more important trading partner due to its growing economy and membership in the World Trade Organisation."], "gemma2:2b": ["China is now Japan's biggest trading partner, surpassing the US in 2004.", "Trade between China and Japan reached record levels in 2004, with imports from China totaling over $214 billion.", "This trend is expected to continue as China's economy grows and participates in global trade organizations."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["China overtook the US to become Japan's biggest trading partner in 2004, surpassing it by about 3 percentage points.", "The numbers show that China accounted for 20.1% of Japan's trade in 2004 compared with 18.6% for the US and 20.5% for the Japanese economy overall.", "Trade between China and Japan grew from 2 billion yen (about $39 million) in 2003 to 22 trillion yen ($214.6 trillion) in 2004, highlighting China's growing importance as a trading partner.", "Trade with the US also faced challenges due to BSE-related restrictions during 2004.", "Analysts predict that China will become even more important in the future and expect strong growth from its membership of the World Trade Organisation and lower tariffs."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["China surpassed the United States as Japan's biggest trading partner in 2004, accounting for 20.1% of Japan's trade compared to 18.6% for the US.", "This marks China's growing importance as an economic powerhouse and highlights changes influenced by factors such as a ban on US beef imports due to mad cow disease (BSE) and strong overall growth in the Chinese economy."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["China surpassed the US as Japan's largest trading partner in 2004, accounting for 20.1% of Japanese trade compared to the US's 18.6%.", "In 2003, the US had a larger share (20.5%) followed by China (19.2%).", "By 2004, Japan\u2019s imports and exports with China (and Hong Kong) reached 22,201bn yen ($214.6bn;
