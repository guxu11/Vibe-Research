{"raw_text": "Saudi NCCI's shares soar\n \n Shares in Saudi Arabia's National Company for Cooperative Insurance (NCCI) soared on their first day of trading in Riyadh.\n \n They were trading 84% above the offer price on Monday, changing hands at 372 riyals ($99; \u00a353) after topping 400 early in the day. Demand for the insurer's debut shares was strong - 12 times what was on sale. The listing was part of the country's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector. Deregulation is expected to boost demand for accident and damage cover.\n \n Previously, only NCCI has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within Saudi Arabia. However, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance. Saudi Arabia now wants a fully functioning insurance industry and is introducing legislation that will clamp down on unauthorised companies. Policy-makers also want to make having insurance more of a requirement, but first have to take steps to boost public confidence in the system, analysts said. As a result, NCCI is being developed as the industry's flagship firm - publicly-listed, with audited accounts. Saudi Arabia sold 7 million NCCI shares, or about 70% of the company's total capital last month. More than 800,000 applicants got 9 shares each for 205 riyals apiece.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Saudi NCCI shares soar on their first day of trading at 372 riyals ($99) after being offered at 84% above the initial price and topping 400 per share early in the day.", "Demand was strong, with sales reaching 12 times what was available to buy.", "The listing is part of Saudi Arabia's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand for accident and damage cover through deregulation."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Shares in Saudi Arabia's National Company for Cooperative Insurance rose 84% on their first day of trading, trading at 372 riyals ($99;
