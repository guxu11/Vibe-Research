{"raw_text": "UK house prices dip in November\n \n UK house prices dipped slightly in November, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has said.\n \n The average house price fell marginally to \u00a3180,226, from \u00a3180,444 in October. Recent evidence has suggested that the UK housing market is slowing after interest rate increases, and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005. But while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market, annual house price inflation is still strong, up 13.8% in the year to November. Economists, however, forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months. \"Overall, the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data,\" said Mark Miller, at HBOS Treasury Services. \"The ODPM data is a fairly lagging indicator.\"\n \n The figures come after the Bank of England said the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. The Halifax, meanwhile, said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in December - the first monthly rise since September.\n \n The UK's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. It is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. It said annual inflation rose between October and November because prices had fallen by 1.1% in the same period in 2003.\n \n The ODPM data showed the average house price was \u00a3192,713 in England; \u00a3139,544 in Wales; \u00a3116,542 in Scotland, and \u00a3111,314 in Northern Ireland.\n \n All areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, where the rate was unchanged, the ODPM said. The North East showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2%, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber on 21.7%, and the North West on 21.1%. The East Midlands, the West Midlands and the South West all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15%. In London, the area with the highest average house price at \u00a3262,825, annual inflation rose only slightly in November to 7.1% from 7% the previous month.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["UK house prices
