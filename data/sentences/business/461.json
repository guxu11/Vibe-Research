{"raw_text": "Beijingers fume over parking fees\n \n Choking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges.\n \n Car ownership has risen fast in recent years, and there are now two and a half million cars on the city's roads. The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. Instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. \"The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,\" said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.\n \n Sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission's road rage. It wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. Mr Wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. Indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure. Mr Wang's team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; \u00a326). The Beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic. Unclogging Beijing's increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the Chinese authorities, who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Beijing officials are reorganizing car parking charges amid high status and expensive fees for indoor parking lots.", "The city now has over 2 million cars on its roads, leading to congestion caused by drivers circling for cheaper outdoor options.", "Officials want to lower indoor prices to match outdoor rates of up to 250%, which can cost as much as 400 yuan per month."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Beijing residents are frustrated with high parking fees, prompting officials to consider reorganizing charges as traffic congestion worsens.", "With two and a half million cars on the streets, expensive indoor parking rates (up to 250% more than outdoor ones) are discouraging drivers from using them, causing traffic jams and road rage.", "Officials plan to adjust prices and explore new payment models to alleviate concerns over poor service and security issues."], "gemma2:2b": ["Beijing faces traffic congestion issues due to increased car ownership and high parking fees.", "Officials plan to adjust parking prices between indoor and outdoor lots to encourage people to use indoor parking.", "They may also increase parking fees near sports grounds for fans.", "Complaints about poor service in exchange for monthly parking fees are being reviewed.", "The Chinese government is tackling the problem of traffic congestion by building new roads ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Key points:\n\n- Beijing car owners face high parking fees and congestion in busy urban areas.", "- Indoor parking charges have become more expensive compared to outdoor lots.", "- The government plans to adjust parking prices, including indoor ones for drivers seeking cheaper options.", "They may also consider increasing public transport fares near sports grounds.", "- There are concerns about the security of indoor car parks due to high costs and potential vandalism.", "- Beijing authorities previously prohibited visitors from using motorcades with motorcycle outriggers as they caused traffic congestion.", "Summary: The government in Beijing is considering raising parking fees for cars, including indoor lots.", "They aim to make it more expensive for drivers searching cheaper options like outdoor car parks near sports grounds.", "They have also proposed increasing public transport fares near major sporting venues."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Beijing officials plan to adjust parking fees to reduce traffic congestion and improve public transportation use among sports fans."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Beijing faces traffic congestion due to rising car ownership and high indoor parking fees compared to outdoor lots.", "Officials aim to adjust prices by closing the gap between indoor and outdoor parking charges, particularly near sports grounds where they plan to increase prices significantly during matches.", "The commission also aims to reduce reliance on personal cars for sporting events by promoting public transport use, including reviewing monthly fees for residents' compulsory service.", "Previously, motorcades of visiting dignitaries were denied motorcycle outriders as these disrupted traffic flow.", "Authorities are building new roads to improve Beijing's infrastructure ahead of the 2008 Olympics."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Beijing fumes over parking fees\n\nChoking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to reorganise car parking charges.", "Car ownership has risen fast in recent years, and there are now two and a half million cars on the city's roads.", "The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them.", "Instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option.", "\"The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,\" said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper.", "Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, suggested his team would adjust parking prices to close the gap.", "Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.", "Sports fans who drive to matches may also encounter difficulties due to the commission's road rage.", "It wants them to use public transport and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds.", "The officials said in Mr Wang\u2019s review team that it might scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches.", "Indoor parking may be costly, but it isn\u2019t always secure.", "The authorities have also been concerned about residents' complaints about poor service received in return for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48;
