{"raw_text": "Disney settles disclosure charges\n \n Walt Disney has settled charges from US federal regulators that it failed to disclose how family members of directors were employed by the company.\n \n The media giant was not fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but has agreed to refrain from any future violations of securities law. Disney failed to tell investors that between 1999 and 2001 it employed three adult children of three then directors. The firm has neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement.\n \n The three Disney directors in question in the central matter of the SEC's investigation - Reveta Bowers, Stanley Gold and Raymond Watson - have all since left the company, with Ms Bowers and Mr Watson both retiring, and Mr Gold quitting in 2003. Their children were paid between $60,000 (\u00a330,800) and $150,000 a year, with shareholders not being informed. The SEC also found that Disney did not disclose that a 50% Disney-owned subsidiary company - Lifetime - employed the wife of current Disney director John Bryson, and that she earned more than $1m a year. Louise Bryson remains with Lifetime.\n \n Disney also failed to disclose payments to Air Shamrock, an airline owned by Mr Gold and fellow former Disney directors Roy Disney. Finally, Disney also did not reveal that it provided more than $200,000 annually for office space, secretarial services, and a leased car and driver to former director Thomas Murphy. \"Shareholders have a significant interest in information regarding relationships between the company and its directors,\" said SEC deputy enforcement director Linda Thomsen. \"Failure to comply with the SEC's disclosure rules in this area impedes shareholders' ability to evaluate the objectivity and independence of directors.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["Disney settles charges over failure to disclose employment of family members and directors, paying $150,000 in fines and agreeing to refrain from future violations of securities law."], "llama3.2:3b": ["Disney has settled charges with US federal regulators for failing to disclose how family members of directors were employed by the company, without admitting wrongdoing.", "The settlement does not result in a fine, but Disney agrees to refrain from future violations.", "The SEC found that Disney failed to disclose payments to employees of subsidiary companies and provided secretarial services to former directors."], "gemma2:2b": ["Disney settled charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to disclose family member employment by directors.", "The company did not admit or deny wrongdoing, but agreed to refrain from future violations.", "The SEC found that Disney failed to disclose payments to family members of certain directors, including those of Lifetime subsidiary, and former director Thomas Murphy's."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["Disney settled charges from US federal regulators, admitting it failed to disclose how family members were employed by Disney.", "Three former directors resigned after 1999-2001: Reveta Bowers, Stanley Gold, and Raymond Watson, left Disney.", "The SEC found that Disney did not disclose financial information related to their children's employment with the subsidiary Air Shamrock and provided more than $200,000 for office space, secretarial services, and a car driver to former Disney director Thomas Murphy."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["Disney has settled charges from US federal regulators for allegedly failing to disclose information about family members employed by the company, while continuing to pay them undisclosed salaries over a decade.", "Disney did not admit or deny wrongdoing but agreed to refrain from future violations of securities law.", "The settlement includes disclosure of employment details for directors' families and former employees at subsidiaries and companies they controlled."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["Disney settles charges from US federal regulators for failing to disclose how family members of directors were employed by the company between 1999 and 2001.", "The settlement comes without a fine, but Disney agrees not to violate securities law in the future.", "Three former directors (Bowers, Gold, Watson) have since left, their children were paid undisclosed salaries from subsidiaries, and Air Shamrock subsidiary employed one director's wife.", "Additionally, Disney did not disclose payments for office space and personal use for another former director.", "The Securities and Exchange Commission emphasized shareholders' right to information about relationships between the company and its directors."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Disney settles disclosure charges.", "Walt Disney has settled charges from US federal regulators that it failed to disclose how family members of directors were employed by the company.", "The media giant was not fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but has agreed to refrain from any future violations of securities law.", "Disney failed to tell investors that between 1999 and 2001 it employed three adult children of three then directors.", "The firm has neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement.", "The three Disney directors in question in the central matter of the SEC's investigation -
