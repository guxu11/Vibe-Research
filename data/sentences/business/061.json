{"raw_text": "Further rise in UK jobless total\n \n The UK's jobless total rose for the second month in a row in December, official figures show.\n \n The number of people out of work rose 32,000 to 1.41 million in the last three months of 2004, even as 90,000 more people were in employment. Average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to December up from November's 4.2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) added. Meanwhile, the benefit claimant total fell 11,000 to 813,200 last month. Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.\n \n The apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. While the UK's jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in Germany, 10.4% in Spain and 9.7% in France. But, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year. The figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the Bank of England will almost certainly raise rates this year. Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities told Reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected, \"it is enough to underline that they (the BoE) will be more hawkish on rates\".\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["The UK's jobless total rose by 32,000 in December to 1.41 million, with a record increase of 296,000 in work in 2004.", "The jobless rate was 4.7% compared to 4.6% in the previous quarter.", "The manufacturing sector suffered an additional 104,000 workers being axed during the year, pushing employment to a record low."], "llama3.2:3b": ["The UK's jobless total rose 32,000 to 1.41 million in the last quarter of 2004, but this was offset by a rise of 90,000 in employment, bringing the total number of people in work to 28.52 million -
