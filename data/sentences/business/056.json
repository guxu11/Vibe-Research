{"raw_text": "BMW drives record sales in Asia\n \n BMW has forecast sales growth of at least 10% in Asia this year after registering record sales there in 2004.\n \n The luxury carmaker saw strong sales of its three marques - BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce - in Asia last year after the launch of three new models. The company, which is vying with Mercedes-Benz for the title of leading premium carmaker, is confident about its prospects for the region in 2005. It is launching a revamped version of its 3-Series saloon class next month.\n \n BMW sold nearly 95,000 cars in Asia last year, up 2.6% on 2003.\n \n BMW-brand sales rose 2.3% to 80,600 while sales of Mini models rose 3.6% to 14,800. There was also a significant increase in sales of Rolls-Royces on the continent. BMW sold more than 100 of the iconic models compared with just ten the previous year. The German carmaker is aiming to boost annual sales in Asia to 150,000 by 2008. \"Here in Asia, we consider a double-digit increase in retail on the order of 10 to 15% to be realistic on the basis of current features,\" said Helmut Panke, BMW's group chief executive.\n \n China remains the main area of concern for BMW after sales there fell 16% last year. However, BMW is hopeful of a much better year in 2005 as its direct investment in China begins to pay dividends. The company only began assembling luxury high-powered sedans in China in 2003. 2004 was generally a good year for BMW, which saw revenues from its core car-making operations rise 11%.\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["BMW forecasts 10% growth in Asia sales this year after registering record sales there in 2004.", "The company has seen strong sales of all three marques in the region: BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce.", "Sales rose by 2.6% last year to nearly 95,000 cars, while Mini models increased by 3.6%.", "Rolls-Royces saw a significant increase, selling over 100 models compared with just ten the previous year.", "The company aims to boost annual sales in Asia to 150,000 by 2008 and sees China as a main area of growth, despite sales falling 16% last year."], "llama3.2:3b": ["BMW forecasts at least 10% sales growth in Asia this year, following record sales in 2004, driven by new models and confident prospects, with China expected to improve after falling 16% last year."], "gemma2:2b": ["BMW achieved record sales in Asia in 2004, and forecasts at least 10% growth in 2005.", "This is attributed to the launch of new models across all three brands (BMW, Mini, Rolls-Royce) and increased confidence in regional prospects.", "Sales grew significantly, with BMW brand sales up 2.3%, Mini sales increasing by 3.6%, and a notable surge in Rolls-Royce sales.", "The company aims to reach 150,000 sales annually in Asia by 2008.", "China remains a key market for BMW despite a year of decline, with the company expecting positive growth in 2005 due to its direct investment in the country.", "Overall, revenue from core car-making operations saw an increase of 11% in 2004."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["BMW's sales forecasted growth of at least 10% in Asia is reported, with three new models launched last year, resulting in a significant increase in sales.", "BMW plans to boost annual sales to 150,000 cars by 2008 in the region.", "China remains one of the main concerns, but BMW has shown an optimistic outlook for 2005 due to its direct investment in China."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["BMW expects an Asian sales increase of at least 10% this year following strong record sales last year and the introduction of new models, aiming to boost annual sales in Asia to over 150,000 by 2008."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["BMW registers record sales in Asia with forecast of at least 10% growth this year.", "Sales increased by 2.6% to nearly 95,000 cars last year, led by strong performance in Mini and Rolls-Royce models.", "BMW expects annual sales in Asia to reach 150,000 by 2008, aiming for a double-digit increase in retail sales (10-15%).", "China remains the main concern with a 16% decrease last year, but BMW anticipates a better performance in 2005 due to increased direct investment.", "Core car-making operations revenue rose 11%."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["BMW drives record sales in Asia, the luxury carmaker sees strong sales of its three marques -
