{"raw_text": "Liberian economy starts to grow\n \n The Liberian economy started to grow in 2004, but \"sustained and deep reform efforts\" are needed to ensure long term growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.\n \n An IMF mission made the comments in a report published following 10 days of talks with the transition government. The IMF said that, according to data provided by the Liberians, the country's GDP rose by 2% in 2004, after a 31% decline in 2003. Liberia is recovering from a 14-year civil war that came to an end in 2003. The power-sharing National Transition Government of Liberia will remain in place until elections on 11 October, the first presidential and parliamentary ballots since the conflict ended.\n \n The IMF said Liberia's economy started to grow last year thanks to a \"continued strong recovery in rubber production, domestic manufacturing and local services including post-conflict reconstruction\". The IMF however remains cautious about what it sees as a lack of transparency in government actions. In particular, it pointed to mystery surrounding the sale of iron ore stockpiles and the alleged disappearance of some import and export permits. These matters are now being investigated by the Liberian authorities and the IMF has called for their findings to be made public. The IMF also said it was crucial that the Central Bank of Liberia be strengthened, the national budget be effectively managed and a sound economic basis built to allow the country's large external debt to be addressed. \"The IMF team stands ready to assist the (Liberian) authorities in strengthening the areas mentioned,\" said the report. \"The team agreed with the (Liberian) authorities that the period until elections and the inauguration of a new government will pose exceptional challenges to fiscal management, and expresses its willingness to provide...continued support.\"\n",
