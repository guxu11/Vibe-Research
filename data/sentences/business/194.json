{"raw_text": "'Post-Christmas lull' in lending\n \n UK mortgage lending showed a \"post-Christmas lull\" in January, indicating a slowing housing market, lenders have said.\n \n Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and Building Society Association (BSA) said lending was down sharply. The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at \u00a317.9bn, compared with \u00a321.8bn in January last year. The BSA said mortgage approvals - loans approved but not yet made - were \u00a32bn, down from \u00a32.6bn in January 2004.\n \n At the same time, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said lending was \"weaker\". Overall, the BBA said mortgage lending rose by \u00a34bn in January, a far smaller increase than the \u00a35.1bn seen in December. This was a return to the \"weaker pattern\" of lending seen in the last months of 2004, the BBA added. However, it is the year-on-year lending comparisons which are the most striking.
