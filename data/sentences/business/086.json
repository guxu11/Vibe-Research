{"raw_text": "Manufacturing recovery 'slowing'\n \n UK manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in one-and-a-half years in January, according to a survey.\n \n The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) said its purchasing manager index (PMI) fell to 51.8 from a revised 53.3 in December. But, despite missing forecasts of 53.7, the PMI number remained above 50 - indicating expansion in the sector. The CIPS said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high.\n \n The survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs. That triggered the second successive monthly fall in the CIPS employment index to 48.3 - its lowest level since June 2003. The survey is more upbeat than official figures - which suggest that manufacturing is in recession - but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam. \"It appears that the UK is in a two-tier economy again,\" said Prebon Yamane economist Lena Komileva. \"You have weakness in manufacturing, which I think would concern policymakers at the Bank of England.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": ["UK manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in one-and-a-half years in January, according to a CIPS survey.", "The purchasing manager index (PMI) fell to 51.8 from 53.3 in December, but remained above forecasts.", "However, rising input prices and cooling demand deterred factory managers from hiring new workers, causing the employment index to fall to 48.3."], "llama3.2:3b": ["UK manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in one-and-a-half years in January with a PMI of 51.8, below forecasts.", "The strong pound dented exports and rising oil and metals prices kept costs high.", "Factory managers cut hiring to cut costs, leading to the lowest employment index since June 2003."], "gemma2:2b": ["UK manufacturing growth slowed to its slowest pace in 18 months in January, falling to 51.8 from a revised 53.3 in December.", "Despite this slowdown, the sector remained in expansion and the survey highlighted challenges like a strong pound, rising oil and metals prices, input price increases, and cooling demand as factors contributing to decreased hiring and slower growth.", "While slightly more optimistic than official recessionary data, analysts see a slowing recovery in manufacturing and a potential two-tier economy structure."], "qwen2.5:0.5b": ["UK manufacturing growth slowed to its slowest pace since January 2018.", "The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) revised its purchasing manager index (PMI) to 53.8 from 53.3 in December, but PMI remained above 50 indicating expansion.", "Rising input prices and rising oil and metals prices have deterred factory managers from hiring new workers.", "The CIPS employment index has fallen to 48.3 since June 2003, which is more upbeat than official data suggesting the UK manufacturing recovery is running out of steam."], "qwen2.5:1.5b": ["UK manufacturing growth decelerated to its slowest pace since 2018 in January, falling from 53.3 to 51.8 on a PMI index, while employment fell to 48.3 due to rising input prices and cooling demand, indicating weaker recovery compared to official data suggesting recession."], "qwen2.5:3b": ["UK manufacturing growth slowed to its weakest pace in 1.5 years in January, with a CIPS PMI index falling to 51.8 from 53.3 in December.", "Despite missing forecasts, it remained above 50 indicating expansion but showed signs of weakening: high input costs and cooling demand deterred hiring, pushing the employment index to its lowest level since June 2003.", "Analysts suggest this indicates manufacturing recovery is losing momentum, with concerns raised by policymakers."], "opencoder:1.5b": ["Manufacturing growth slowed by 1-and-a-half years during January according to a survey conducted by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS).", "The CIPS index decreased from December's 53.3 to 51.8, showing the industry's slow pace in recovery after missing forecasts on December 7.", "Despite significant increases in input prices and increased cooling demand, factory managers were unable to hire new workers to cut costs, triggering a drop in employment levels to 48.3."], "smollm:1.7b": ["The summary should be: Manufacturing recovery slowed down in January 2019, with a PMI falling to 51.8 from 53.3 in December.", "Despite missing forecasts of 53.7, the PMI number remained above 50 -
