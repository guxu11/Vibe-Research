The user has provided a text and wants it summarized into just plain text without any explanations or formatting. They specified that they want only the summary preserved, so I need to make sure I capture all key points accurately.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the original text carefully. The main topic is about Laporte's confidence for an upcoming match with England. There are some specific details about their performance against Scotland, the coach's comments, and where he will announce his lineup.\n\nI notice that the summary should be concise but include all important elements. So, I'll start by identifying the main events: Laporte predicting a possible scare to counter England's strengths, mentions of his confidence going into the match, the team's performance against Scotland, coach's comments about not being good as favourites, and the excitement for playing with France.\n\nI need to make sure that each key point is included without adding any personal opinions. Also, since the user wants only plain text, I should avoid using any markdown or special formatting. The summary shouldn't include any explanations or reasoning; it's just a straightforward read-through of the important points.\n\nNow, putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to first state Laporte's confidence in facing England, mention the team's performance against Scotland as a positive point, his comments about not being good as favourites, and then introduce where he will announce his lineup. I should ensure that each sentence flows logically from one point to the next without any unnecessary details.\n\nI also need to watch out for grammar and clarity, making sure the summary reads smoothly as if it's an official summary. Let me piece this together: Start with Laporte's belief in the team's ability to counter, mention the team's positive performance against Scotland, his confidence going into the game, the team's usual struggles when they are favourites, his excitement upon receiving the call-up, and finally where he will announce his lineup.\n\nDouble-checking for any missing points: The text mentions England's six-nation series on Sunday, but since it's just about their performance against Scotland, I'll include that as a positive sign. Also, ensuring that Laporte isn't seen as expecting too much, which is important given his past performances with France being challenging.\n\nI think that covers all the necessary elements without overcomplicating things. Time to put it into plain text and make sure it's concise.\n</think>\n\nLaporte believes his team will be scared going up against England on Sunday but expects it to work in their favor.
