The key idea is to preserve the main points and details while making it as short and clear as possible. They also specified that I should output only the summary without any explanations or formatting.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the entire text carefully to understand the main points. The text is about two athletes, Greene and Maurice Greene, discussing their goals in a race scenario. There's mentions of gold medals, sprint races, world championships, Olympic titles, and some specific events like the 100m and relay.\n\nI notice that the user provided an example response which included key details such as their goals, the medal results, the closeness of the race, energy management, and other supporting information. My task is to extract these essential points without adding any extra words or explanations.\n\nI'll start by identifying the main subjects: Greene's world title aiming for four World Championships, his bronze medal in Greece, and the context of being second when he lost a sprint to Obikwelu. He mentions conserving energy during the race but was cautious during the final stages. There are also mentions of medals from other competitors like Mark Lewis-Francis, the current world record holder, and the relay results.\n\nI need to make sure that all these points are included in the summary without any repetition or unnecessary details. I'll structure it so each main idea is clear and concise, using bullet points where appropriate for readability.\n\nAfter extracting all necessary information, I'll write a summary that flows smoothly, ensuring each paragraph transitions logically from one point to another.
