The team has lost 12 of their 14 games under him. He didn't experience an RBS victory yet because the last one was against a weak team. He also said the comparison with Berti Vogts from Australia is bizarre and humorous.\n\nHe's trying to enjoy the pressure even though there's still a chance they could win the series without a victory.
