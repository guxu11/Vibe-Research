{"raw_text": "Jones files Conte lawsuit\n \n Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\n \n The Sydney Olympic gold medallist says Conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (\u00a313m) in the suit. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte's statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America's most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte's statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.\n \n \"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport's ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte's allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Jones files lawsuit against Conte for defamation over allegations he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nJones claims Conte damaged her reputation and wants $25m in damages.

The lawyer said that the defendants had made unsubstantiated allegations on television and email, and also demanded to pass a lie detector examination. \"The evidence presented by Conte\u2019s statements were deftly false and malicious,\" he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, a US-based Associated Press statement stated that Conte was indifferent to the truth about Marion Jones's actions. The verdict came as a result of the ABC television program earlier this month, when Conte referred to \"everything I said\" and made accusations of false and malicious statements. The suit also argued that Conte had not taken banned performance-enhancing drugs before her interview.\n\nJones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney during 2000, which is a testament to the sport's dominance over other countries. The claim that Conte damaged her reputation and demanded money from a US agency sparked suspicion. \"I stand by everything I said,\" Jones added. The US Anti-Doping Agency, who has a proven track record of defending against drug-related violations, contacted Jones after a hearing in San Francisco.\n\nJones's lawyer Richard Nicholas said that the IAAF maintained a cautious approach to her accusations and directed them towards the agency. The agency was seeking information from Conte for further clarification about her conduct, which he dismissed as unsubstantiated.\n\nIn light of the facts presented by Conte\u2019s interview and the investigation by the IAAF, Jones' case has been closed on both sides, with the USA Track and Field deciding that it is appropriate to take action against Marion Jones. The IAAF also noted that the verdict was not \"unanimous\" but more likely a matter of public confidence in the defendant's conduct.\n\nJones, who had a history of negative experiences and failed tests related to drugs, has continually denied ever using illegal substances, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. The court further upheld her testimony, arguing that the only evidence was deftly false and malicious accusations made by Conte at her television interview.\n", "smollm:1.7b": "Jones files lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss after alleging he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.", "deepseek-r1:1.5b": "<think>\nAlright, I need to summarize the provided text concisely while preserving key ideas and details.
