Let's start by reading through it carefully.\n\nFirst, it mentions that Serbia won the tennis match with Ana Ivanovic. She captured her first WTA title, which is a big deal for her because she's from Serbia and maybe earns more money or something. The match was against Hungarian Melinda Czink, who came in late but still managed to win.\n\nThe scoreline was 7-5 to 6-1, with Ivanovic taking the last set. She beat Czink in the final round of qualifying, which is normal for tournaments where some players drop out early because they had injuries or withdrew. However, despite that, she didn't make it all the way to the main draw as Melinda Czink did, who probably came back later.\n\nIvanovic was 17 years old when she started this, which I think is a good thing for her age group since she's from Serbia, maybe she was young and strong. She also mentioned that she had won her junior Wimbledon title last year, which might have given her some experience or motivation to improve for the bigger WTA event.\n\nShe will play against Iveta Benesova in the first round of the Australian Open, which is another important match up. The text doesn't provide details about how this victory went, but I can assume it was a high-quality performance and a big confidence boost for her.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all these key points: Ivanovic's title, her age, her victory strategy, the circumstances of Czink, and what this means for her future. I should avoid adding any extra info beyond that because the user asked for only the summary.\n</think>\n\nAna Ivanovic captivated her first WTA title in a 17-year-old with a straight-sets victory over Hungarian Melinda Czink at the Canberra Classic.
