Let me read through the provided text carefully.\n\nThe main event is that Tom Shanklin misses the England clash against Wales because Sonny Parker couldn't recover from a neck nerve after his injury. That's a key point. \n\nTom Shanklin was his first-choice wing but prefers the center, which makes sense since he's handling defense and attacking as a wing. He'll start in the center, which is good for their defense.\n\nLooking at the other players: Hal Luscombe takes Shanklin's wing role. The front line has Mefin Davies starting up ahead of Robin McBryde who was resting because of an injury. They probably took his place after him recovering from a neck disc problem.\n\nUp front, Mathew Tait is playing as a hooker, and open-side Martyn Williams is fit to start. Rob Sidoli comes back for the first time since last season's Six Nations game. Sidoli was out before, but now he\u2019s ready, so the defense will have him in there.\n\nFor the second row, Robin McBryde had been resting because of a groin issue that made him sit uncapped after a recent neck injury. That means he'll start soon after his injury comes back. \n\nWilliams is mentioned to be 50 caps ahead of Colin Charvis who left with a quick recovery from a neck problem. That\u2019s significant, so Williams needs to get into the game.\n\nIn terms of defense, Luscombe is taking the wing role. The backline has someone called Kevin Morgan taking out the middle, but I think that's not part of the main focus here. \n\nLooking at the players on the bench or injured: Mathew Tait left for a short while after playing in, and Mathew Owen was there when Tait left. Then, George Jenkins is replacing Gareth Llewellyn who was out because of a neck injury. \n\nI also see that Sidoli is back for his first time since last season\u2019s Six Nations. The second-row players include Joe Worsley and Lewis Moody, who were back-ups before their injuries but are now starting fresh. \n\nThe forward trio from England is Lewis Moody, Joe Worsley, and Andy Hazell, who had been with Scarlets for a while. They\u2019ve been doing well since the injury.\n\nSo putting it all together, the summary should highlight Shanklin's absence due to Parker\u2019s injury, his wing role, and how his preference for center works out. It also needs to mention the other key players on each side, especially Sidoli coming back and Williams getting started quickly because of his recovery. \n\nI need to make sure I include all these details without adding extra information or explanations, just a concise summary.\n</think>\n\nTom Shanklin is missing the England clash against Wales due to Sonny Parker's neck nerve injury. He starts in the center and prefers wing role, while Hal Luscombe takes his wing.

The second row includes Joe Worsley and Lewis Moody, starting fresh after a groin problem, while Williams starts quickly due to recovery.
