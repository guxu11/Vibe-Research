{"raw_text": "Ireland 17-12 South Africa\n \n Ronan O'Gara scored all Ireland's points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over South Africa on an emotional day at Lansdowne Road.\n \n O'Gara's first-half try, poached after a quick tap-penalty, helped the Irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. Three further O'Gara penalties extended Ireland's lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. Two Percy Montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but Ireland held out to claim a famous victory. Ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. Aware of the threat posed by the South Africans, Ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. Early on, Denis Hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but Shane Horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee Paul Honiss.\n \n Ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. Another South African infringement a minute later led to Ireland's first points - O'Gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an Irish try. The Springboks could feel hard done by as captain John Smit had his back to the play when O'Gara pounced after referee Honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. Stung by the score, the South Africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with Geordan Murphy's ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for Percy Montgomery. However, the Springboks did win a penalty a minute later which Montgomery easily slotted to cut Ireland's lead to 5-3.\n \n Ireland got out of jail when the South Africans had a three-to-one overlap near the Irish line only to waste the chance. After the sustained Springboks pressure, the Irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with O'Gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. Sustained Irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another O'Gara penalty. However, Montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut Ireland's lead to five points again. Montgomery then burst through the Irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb Girvan Dempsey tackle to prevent a try. The South Africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when Schalk Burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and O'Gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty.\n \n In the 61st minute, Hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from Girvan Dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. However, a late tackle on Brian O'Driscoll enabled O'Gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended Ireland's lead to 17-6. However, two Montgomery penalties had Ireland's lead in peril again as the Springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining.

Here's a possible summary:\n\n\"Ireland 17-12 South Africa\" is a rugby match that took place on November 30, 2019 at Lansdowne Road in Dublin, Ireland. The game was played between the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) and the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU).\n\nThe Irish team, led by captain John Smit, had a strong squad with players such as Brian O'Driscoll, G Dempsey, and B Botha. The Irish defense was well-organized and managed to hold off the Springboks attack from the start of the game. However, South Africa's possession and attacking flair proved too much for the Irish team to handle.\n\nThe Irish offense, led by O'Gara, made a series of clever passes and tackles to get the ball back into their own hands. The Irish defense was able to hold on to the ball for several minutes before it was turned over or lost possession.\n\nIn the 61st minute, South Africa's defense managed to score two tries against Ireland, but they were quickly countered by a series of Irish tackles and passes. In the 75th minute, South Africa scored a try on a penalty kick from G Dempsey, who was able to get the ball back into their own hands after a poor pass from O'Gara.\n\nThe Irish defense held on to the game until the end of the match, but they were ultimately outplayed by South Africa and lost 17-6. The Irish team's performance in this match is considered one of their best in recent years.", "deepseek-r1:1.5b": "<think>\nAlright, I need to summarize this Ireland vs. South Africa rugby match. Let me read through the text carefully.\n\nSo, Ireland scored 17 points and came out on an emotional day at Lansdowne Road. They had only their second win overall. Their first try was a tap penalty after a backline move by Denis Hickie, giving them an 8-3 lead. Then they scored two more penalties to make it 17-6.\n\nThe South Africans were threatening but struggled early on. Paul Honiss gave them a quick response with a try, and then Smit tried to respond but was blocked. The game went back-to-back, which is common in rugby matches.\n\nIreland kept trying to score, and in the 34th minute, O'Gara made a clever drop-goal to get it back to five points at half-time. Then they had more pressure, and O'Gara scored again with two penalties. However, the South Africans responded by slotting over a penalty near the right touchline and forcing another try.\n\nIn the 52nd minute, Schalk Burger was sin-binned for two weeks in a row. That probably gave South Africa a chance to respond. But I don't see any indication of it happening, which could be a big blow for Ireland.\n\nIreland held onto their lead with Paul Honiss' final tackle in the 63rd minute. They had seven minutes left and still won, claiming a deserved victory. The game was closely fought throughout, and South Africa's captain Smit made a strong impression by scoring early on despite being near the play when O'Gara scored.\n\nIn summary, Ireland's key players were O'Gara, Paul Honiss, and maybe some others like Denis Hickie and Shane Horgan. South Africa had Smit, Schalk Burger, and possibly another forward like De Wet Barry or Jefan Venter. The match was intense with both sides pressing their sides hard.\n\nI need to make sure I capture the main points: Ireland won on an emotional day, first half try, second half attempts leading them to 17-6, South Africans had a tough start but fell back, Paul Honiss scoring early in a big threat spot.
