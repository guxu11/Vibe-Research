Despite his team's position in the Premier League being second when they faced Liverpool, Liverpool midfielder David Allen remained dominant, and he promised not to rest on his laurels for European football. The idea that Weir had achieved anything yet, as he told BBC Radio Five Live, seemed unsettling. He said he wouldn't be making any statements or looking too far into the future, as he was confident he would make accurate predictions and soon fall back into trouble if he misled the team. The sport was a game of self-belief and hard work that came together over time.
