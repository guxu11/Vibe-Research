But Woodward added: \"The key thing that I want to stress is that I intend to use the Six Nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. \"My job, along with all the other senior representatives, is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. \"If you are not playing international rugby then it's still a step up to Test rugby.
