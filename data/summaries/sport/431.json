Jamie Delgado and Lee Childs have been called into the squad in Tel Aviv as designated hitters for team practice but Bates has no plans to call either of them into his squad at present.\n \n The unheralded Sherwood was the surprise inclusion when the squad was announced last week, and Bates said: \"David has earned his place in this squad on the merit of his form and results over the last 12 months.\" The 6ft 4in Sherwood is ranked 264th in the world and the LTA have high hopes for him after Futures tournament wins in Wrexham and Edinburgh.\n \n The Sheffield-born right-hander, aged 24, also reached another final in Plaisir, France, a week after making the semi-final in Mulhouse. Bates is glad to have Rusedski available after Tim Henman's retirement from Davis Cup tennis. \"His wealth of experience is invaluable, particularly to the younger players and I know he will lead by example,\" Bates said. \"We are looking forward to the tie.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first paragraph mentions that Parmar ruled out of the Davis Cup tie because he has a knee injury and is unable to recover before the European/Africa Zone I tie starts in Israel. Alex Bogdanovic is coming in to take the second singles place instead of him. That's a key point, so I should note both their statuses.\n\nNext, it says that Parmar was out last week but hasn't recovered yet for his Europe/Africa Zone I tie against Abel and Rostem. So he might be missing some games here.\n\nBogdanovic is set to take the second singles place alongside Greg Rusedski. Both are out from their previous tournaments due to injury, but they're expected to be fit now. That's important because it affects who else could make a spot in doubles.\n\nGB captain Jeremy Bates has 17-year-old Andrew Murray and David Sherwood for the doubles. He mentioned that neither were called into his squad yet but is looking forward to seeing them. It also says that Sherwood was a surprise addition, being ranked 264th and LTA had high hopes because he won futures tournaments in Wrexham and Edinburgh.\n\nSherwood is from Sheffield, right? I should include that. Another key point is that the squad includes Rusedski again after Tim Henman retired. That's good news for his availability.\n\nBates was happy about Rusedksi being back after Tim Henman's retirement. \"His experience is valuable,\" he said. They're looking forward to the tie, and the squad is in good form. \n\nI need to make sure I capture all these points: Parmar's injury, Bogdanovic's participation, Rusedski's return, Sherwood's inclusion, and the team's overall situation. Also, making it concise without any explanations or formatting.\n\nHmm, I should structure it so each main point is clear. Maybe start with Parmar being out, then Bogdanovic taking singles place, Rusedski returning, Sherwood getting a spot, and the squad's composition. \n\nI have to keep it simple, just plain text without any extra info. Make sure all key names likeParmsar, Bogdanovic, Rusedski, Sherwood are included with their correct placements in the tie.\n</think>\n\nPartram ruled out of the Davis Cup tie due to a knee injury and was unable to recover before starting his Europe/Africa Zone I tie in Israel.
