The Bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against France, with either Tait or Noon dropping out.\n \n Tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from Robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted Cardiff was an \"unforgiving place\" for the teenage prodigy. Robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to England's future. Tait himself, at least outwardly, appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by Gavin Henson in particular. \"I want more of that definitely,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we'll have to look at the video and wait and see. \"We were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult.

The midfield pairing could be affected too, with Mathew Tait and Jamie Noon at risk. Olly Barkley improved his field position after replacing Tait before the half-hour.\n\nThere's a mention of Tait's performance \u2013 he had some moments where he showed promise but was criticized for being overlooked by Roberson because of his injury. Robinson is considering withdrawing from firing decisions, having only one game against Wales to watch.\n\nOn the home side in Paris with France, Tait and Noon are likely starting, though it seems Tait might drop out. The team-mate Noon missed a tackle on Owen but showed improvement later. England's defense was solid early on, so they need better playmakers inside the center role.\n\nThe front line still has some flaws despite Chris Jones' strong performance, especially considering his side moved to step back after Moody's debut.
