Let me read through the text carefully first.\n\nThe main points are about England's defensive crisis. The text mentions that Tottenham's Ledley King has withdrawn from the squad because of his groin injury, affecting the team's ability in their upcoming match against Holland. Additionally, John Terry and Wayne Bridge are also out, leading to a problem for Wednesday's game at Villa Park.\n\nSven-Goran Eriksson is involved with the match, and there are some injured players like Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell who haven't started yet. Matthew Upson has already pulled out. Also, Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher have likely taken their place as a makeshift team in the absence of Terry and Ferdinand.\n\nAnother point from Manchester United's history: Brown had been a starter for England against Australia last February. Now he seems to be a senior player for the club. King was forced out due to an injury assessment, and Terry is out due to his knee injury. Eriksson hasn't decided yet whether to bring in any more back-ups.\n\nI should highlight the key events: King's withdrawal, Terry and Bridge'savailability issues, Upson's absence, Brown's history, and the missing players' statuses.\n\nI need to make sure all these points are included without unnecessary details.
