Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence is a quote from Andy Roddick: \"Big guns ease through in San Jose.\" That's probably highlighting the event in San Jose. \n\nThen there are two players, Andre Agassi and Hyung Taik Lee, who made it to the last eight. I should note their seeds and how they did despite some early problems.\n\nAgassi faced a tough start with Dane Carlsen but won 7-5 6-1. He used some powerful shots like lobs and set up Sendy. That's a key point about Agassi's play. Also, his form didn't improve much since he was down 0-40 at the start.\n\nRoddick faced another tough opponent, Jurgen Melzer from Germany. They played to a draw, which is interesting because Melzer is often a strong player. He won 6-3 6-3 against Xavier Malisse and secured a win in Delray Beach last week. That's a good point about his previous performance.\n\nCyril Saulnier faced Czech qualifier Tomas Zib. Saulnier outperformed the players he faced, winning 6-1 7-6. He used power from the backhand and set up Zib effectively. That shows he can handle the challenge well.\n\nThen there's a quote about Agassi's form: \"I'm not playing great,\" but he's through. The reason given is that people think it's easy to play well weekly, which doesn't hold. That's interesting because it gives hope or reassurance to those expecting some improvement.\n\nThe text also mentions that Agassi has been through multiple downsets and set up Carlsen, but he didn't improve his form much. He came from 0-40 down and had a strong serve. \n\nSo, the summary should capture all these points: who made it to the final, their performances, what they faced, and some overall observations about their performance.\n\nI need to make sure I include all key details without getting too bogged down in specifics.
