Let me read through it carefully.\n\nSo, Philippoussis suffered a groin injury in the Hopman Cup against Netherlands. He tore two adductor muscles, meaning the muscles around his neck that control breathing and movement. That probably caused him to miss the deciding match in mixed doubles against Novak Djokovic on January 17th in Melbourne.\n\nHe's now uncertain about February's Australian Open because he can't play for a couple of weeks. The doctor, Hamish Osborne, thinks it's unlikely for him to participate in more than one set or two days in a row after such a long injury recovery period.\n\nPhilippoussis is hoping he'll get better with treatment soon and try again as soon as possible. He says movement issues won't stop him but will slow his progress.\n\nTommy Haas, another player, had a thigh injury from Germany's Hopman Cup loss to 7-5 2-2 against Guillermo Coria. It seems he can still play for the future but might have some movement problems too.\n\nThe main points are Philippoussis' injury, his inability to play the Australian Open, and his recovery status.
