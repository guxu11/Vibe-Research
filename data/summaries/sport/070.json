{"raw_text": "Record fails to lift lacklustre meet\n \n Yelena Isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record, but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in Birmingham.\n \n And hey, there are not many meets that go by without the Russian breaking a world record.\n \n Apparently, Isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and I would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time. Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can, and I would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition. Mind you, every time she breaks the record she gets $30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. She looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.\n \n It would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only he hadn't got himself disqualified. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark is looking in much better shape. But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.\n \n Something else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money. She had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Yelena Isinbayeva cleared 5m in training but did not extend the indoor record, with Kelly Holmes looking good and Agnes Samaria dominating the 800m event.

Kelly Holmes performed exceptionally well, with clear comments praising his performance. The evening was a testament to consistency and determination by Kelly Holmes. Agnes Samaria is in top shape for this season's world records, while Jason Gardener has some experience but faces challenges to compete at the European Indoor Championships. Mark Lewis-Francis had potential but struggles may make him less fit. Mark, though healthy, hasn't convinced himself he can enter the European Indoor Championships. His false-start tactics could also cause embarrassment. Despite his disqualification, Mark is in better shape. Jason Gardener's pacing has been an issue, and while he has some experience, it remains to be seen if he'll compete at the European Championships. Melanie Purkiss secured a new personal best in the women's 400m race with a record of 52.98 seconds. Kim Wall and Lee McConnell are solid in other events, leading a promising 4x400m squad for the European Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is likely to run too, adding another layer of strength. From an international perspective, Meseret Defar showed potential in the 3,000m but was overshadowed by pace-making. Heather Hennigar set a fast start but struggled to maintain it. If Bernard Lagat had been in better shape last year, he might have done even better. Kenenisa Bekele was beaten by Markos Geneti, though expectations for him were lower as he's been struggling this season. The challenges of a hot environment and poor breath in the commentary box impacted the distance runners, with Defar complaining afterward.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "The Birmingham meeting, which had an absence of world record attempts, had not provided the best opportunity for top performers like Olympic champion Kelly Holmes or world bronze medalist Samaria Agnes to showcase their abilities. However, the European Indoor Championships are on the horizon and with Jason Gardeners struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish and Mark Lewis-Francis under false start game, British 60m hurdler Sarah Claxton emerged as a strong candidate for a medal. Despite her disappointing performance in the women's national 400m race, Scottish athlete Lee McConne is expected to join the team going to the European Championships. The meet also provided opportunities for Kenesis Bekele to showcase his strength and distance running abilities, but he was well beaten by Markos Geneti.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " The athletics meet held in Birmingham, featured a few notable performances and notable absences. It was notable for some reasons, but it would be best if we could focus on the key events and results, such as the world record attempts and personal bests achieved during the competition. \n\nMeseret Defar finished second in the women's 3,000m steeplechase, which was her most recent major event before this meet. She had set an exceptional personal best of 8:41.67 earlier this year in Rotterdam, and had hoped to improve on that time in Birmingham. However, she struggled with the conditions and finished a bit behind the winner, Canadian Heather Hennigar, who clocked 8:39.50.\n\nIn the men's competition, Bernard Lagat won the 1500m event in 2:41.77, which was almost exactly matching his previous PB of 2:41.66 from the 2000 World Indoor Championships. He may have not been at his best, but he still managed to win with relative ease compared to his competitors.\n\nMark Lewis-Francis, a notable contender in the men's 60m race, was disqualified for attempting to run a false start. He had started ahead of his rivals and had been given an automatic warning, which he later apologized for. This incident highlights the importance of clean athletes following proper sportsmanship guidelines.\n\nIn the women's 60m hurdles, Ronald Pognon achieved a personal best of 8.12 seconds, which was his second-best time ever in the event. He had previously set his current PB of 7.94 seconds in 2009. This win gives France a competitive edge against the rest of Europe when it comes to women's athletics.\n\nThe women's 4x400m relay, featuring Melanie Purkiss, Sarah Claxton, Kim Wall, and Lee McConnell, was undoubtedly a highlight of the meet. They finished with a time of 3:52.67, which is the new European Championship standard and one of the fastest times ever recorded in history.\n\nIn the men's 4x400m relay, Scotland had an impressive performance with their time of 3:12.98. This was a new personal best for Scottish athletes, and it demonstrated that they have a strong pool of talented athletes who are ready to compete at the highest levels in 2017.\n\nFrom an international perspective, I think there were some standout performances from individuals like Heather Hennigar, Kenenisa Bekele, and Bernard Lagat. They all had personal bests or very close calls in their respective events. For example, Heather Hennig's 3,000m time of 8:42.18 is almost identical to her previous PB of 8:40.56 from the 2008 US Olympic Trials, which puts her in great shape for a medal at the European Championships this summer.\n\nAs for Kenenisa Bekele, he may not have been on his best form in Birmingham, but he has been working hard this season. His 1500m time of 3:49.87 is almost identical to his previous PB of 3:46.77 from the 2015 World Indoor Championships. He may not have achieved his personal best in this competition, but he still managed to finish in the top-six for Beijing and has a lot of potential for a strong performance at the European Championships.", "phi:2.7b": " Yelena Isinbayeva's world record attempt at Birmingham did not go as well as expected, but Russian athletes have a history of breaking records.
