He said he hopes to contribute to planning and preparation, ensuring the media and public get the most out of it.

There was controversy over the diaries of players like Matt Dawson and Austin Healey, which compounded concerns about media handling.\n\nWoodward is expected to be the head coach at New Zealand's Lions, attracting a massive media audience with large numbers from the traveling team, fans, and the public. To handle the pressure, strategy and processes need to be set up.

The Lions are traveling from 24 May to Christchurch, with their first match against the All Blacks on June 25th.\n\nI need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll focus on key points: Campbell's role as consultant, his background, his previous work, his current plans, Woodward's coaching at New Zealand, the media attention expected, and his upcoming government resume.\n\nI should make sure not to include details about Graham Henry or the initial controversy, just state that Woodward saw improvements.
