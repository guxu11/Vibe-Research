That shows they're looking for consistency and not too much resting.\n\nThierry Henry scored against Fulham and described the performance as \"beautifully played.\" He emphasized the importance of winning points, especially the three, which are crucial. He also touched on why they might lose some games but still enjoy the experience, mentioning past losses where they lost but still bounced back.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to capture his disappointment, the current situation with Newcastle's standings and injuries, their recent form against Fulham, Henry's performance, and the overall strategy of preparing for future games by winning previous ones.
