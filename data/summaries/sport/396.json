He talks about how challenging it is to beat them up there and focuses on that game. He mentions worrying about Ireland after beating Scotland. That part is important because it shows his preparation ahead.\n\nLooking at the other teams: Kevin Morgan could be replacing Williams for full-back, leaving Williams and Hal Luscombe for the right wing. Luscombe might be missing a start in Murrayfield but is expected to make it. Robert McBryde has a knee injury and needs to rest, so he's not selected yet.\n\nThe assistant coach says they've worked through things and there are some positive reports. They're building depth by getting back some players. Scotland won their first campaign win against Italy on Saturday, which helps Wales' case but isn't the main focus.\n\nWales' coach Scott Johnson emphasizes that it's a tough opposition from Italy. He wants Wales to prepare well because they've already secured their first three wins.
