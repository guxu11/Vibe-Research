{"raw_text": "What now for British tennis?\n \n Tim Henman's decision to quit Davis Cup tennis has left the British team with a gargantuan void to fill.\n \n The world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has 36 from his 50 rubbers). And Great Britain's last Davis Cup win without Henman came against Slovenia as far back as 1996. Worse could follow, according to former British team member Chris Bailey. Bailey told BBC Sport: \"After Tim's announcement, I doubt Greg Rusedski will be that far behind him.\" But without their top two, where does that leave British ambitions in the sport's premier team event? Captain Jeremy Bates has singled out Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as potential replacements. The Yugoslavian-born Bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below Henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.\n \n Murray, on the other hand, is 407th in the current ATP entry list and yet to make his cup debut. But Bailey does see some hope for the future. He said: \"Now we've dropped down to the Euro-Africa zone, the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.\" Britain's next opponents, Israel, are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 March match against a likely trio of Bogdanovic, Murray and the 187th-ranked Arvind Parmar. Bailey said: \"It will be tough for GB to move up, but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. This was always going to be inevitable with Tim and Greg's growing years. \"I'm confident about the future. I wouldn't lay money on us getting back into the world group next year, but I'd imagine in five years time we'll be competing for the major honours.\" Of those lining up to replace Henman, the 17-year-old Murray, with four Futures titles under his belt last year, looks the best long-term bet. \"Murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over Tim's mantle,\" said Bailey. \"He has an enormous amount of self-confidence, judging by what he's said in the past.\" Bogdanovic, three years Murray's senior, has had a more troubled time under Britain's Davis Cup umbrella.\n \n While Murray has been marked out as Britain's golden boy, Bogdanovic was warned by the Lawn Tennis Association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003. And Bailey said: \"Despite that, Alex is clearly talented as well, while Arvind is another contender. \"They're among the guys who have experienced the intensity of Davis Cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines. \"The LTA has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that. \"Now they'll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup. And I'm confident that will springboard Team GB to greater success.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "British tennis is left with a void following Tim Henman's decision to quit Davis Cup tennis, which has tied him for fourth place among British players.

The user provided a detailed response with key points highlighted, but I should do it on my own first. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The main events are Tim leaving the Davis Cup in favor of his international team. The UK's team still needs to fill gaps. Henman is fourth among the top 50 rankings for wins, which is a big issue because they've had three wins already. He lost to Rusedski and an earlier match against Slovenia.\n\nThen, there are some replacements mentioned: Jeremy Bates is choosing Bogdanovic (184th) and Murray (407th). Bogdanovic hasn't played many matches, only two so far, winning one and losing the other. Murray has a recent win but didn't make the team yet. Chris Bailey is optimistic, saying it's time for them to show their talent.\n\nThe upcoming match against Israel in March is expected to be tough, with participants having a bad year. They might not compete at their best again. The LTA is doing well, ensuring good results from their matches. \n\nI need to keep the summary concise, only including key ideas and details. I should mention Henman's departure, the team's gap, his win history, future players, potential replacements, and the match ahead. Also, include the LTA's role.\n\nLet me make sure I don't miss any important points like Tim being fourth in rankings for wins, Rusedski and someone from 1996, Bogdanovic's age, Murray's current standings, and the upcoming match details.\n</think>\n\nTim Henman has decided to leave the UK Davis Cup tennis team in favor of his international team. Henman, currently ranked fourth with 36 wins out of 50, had earlier lost to Greg Rusedski and an earlier match against Slovenia. The UK's top team still faces a gap that could hinder their success. Replacing Henman would include replacing Bogdanovic (184th) and Murray (407th). Murray has recently won but hasn't competed yet, while Bogdanovic, though young, hasn't played many matches.

The current captain, Jeremy Batres, is hopeful for younger players like Alex Bogdanovi\u010d and Andrew Murray, but Bailey believes that now is the time for them to take over from Henman in the senior team. Meanwhile, Bogdanovi\u010d has had his fair share of difficulties during his Davis Cup career, with warnings from the Tennis Association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003, while Murray and Arvind Parmar are likely to move up as players looking to take over.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " After Tim Henman's Davis Cup tennis retirement, his position on the British team is left as an undeniable void.

Captain Jeremy Bates has singled out Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as potential replacements for Henman.
