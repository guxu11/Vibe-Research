Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst paragraph says Charvis is set to lose fitness bid for Wales' final two games. That's a bit confusing\u2014fitness bid? Maybe they're suggesting he might not play. Then it says Colin Charvis is unlikely to play, missing three games with an ankle injury and his recovery hasn't been great.\n\nWales has players like Sonny Parker and Mark Davies. They mention that Charvis won't figure into the Scots game or the final match for Wales, and his fitness isn't in good shape. They also talk about other key players like Hal Luscombe, who is expected to be fit after missing France due to a hamstring issue.\n\nThen it goes on about Wales' assistant coach Scott Johnson's comments. He says they're positive about Hal, hoping he'll come back quickly, and mentions another player, Robin McBryde, who might not play and is injured. They mention Steve Jones from the Dragons drafting him if he doesn't recover, which could be important.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all key points without adding any extra information. So focus on Charvis's situation, his missing games, what other players are involved, and how their injury statuses affect the game. That should give a clear summary.\n</think>\n\nCharvis is set to miss fitness bid for Wales' final two Six Nations games. Colin Charvis, who missed three games with an ankle injury, is unlikely to play any role in the Scots or remaining final matches. Wales' key players include Sonny Parker and Mark Davies, who will focus on other high-profile matchups.
