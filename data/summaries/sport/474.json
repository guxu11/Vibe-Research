The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It's hard to go out there and get it right but I'm fighting and I'm hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort.
