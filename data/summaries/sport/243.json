Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, it says Liverpool are keeping their manager, Rick Parry, who's been in charge since 2017. The main thing reported is that Chelsea wants to keep him because they\u2019re renewing their bid for him from Anfield. But there's also a report saying Chelsea is considering a \u00a335m transfer, which could happen by January. \n\nThen it moves on to detail how Gerrards wants to win the Champions League and title. He scored a big late goal in the 3-1 victory over Olympiakos. The summary mentions that Parry said there's no chance of him going in January, so Chelsea isn't moving forward. But the text also notes that Gerrards is ambitious but both teams want to win, which is his main motivator.\n\nGerrards had talked before about considering leaving if Liverpool were knocked out of Europe or if he was with Real Madrid. So it's not just about getting a spot in the Champions League but about long-term success for both teams.\n\nThe text also mentions that the main point Parry made is to stay on the team, challenging for the league title and title all the time. They should focus on wins, not just great ones. He's already scored a lot of goals and has a history of being a team captain. The text adds that he's putting pressure on himself because it was said he wanted to win the most important game he ever played.\n\nRafael Benitez is another manager mentioned. He thinks Gerrards can achieve everything without moving teams, but if they want more games or important ones, they need him in the squad. He appreciates his strength and leadership style.\n\nI think I need to capture all these points: Parry's stance on staying, Chelsea's bid, the Champions League goal, and the relationship between the two teams. Also, mention that both are focused on long-term success, not just immediate wins.\n</think>\n\nLiverpool have confirmed that their manager, Rick Parry, remains with Steven Gerrards despite reports of a \u00a335m transfer from Chelsea. Parry stated there's no chance of him joining in January, with Chelsea considering an outright bid for the \u00a335 million. Liverpool also highlighted Gerrards' ambition to win the champions league and title all the time, with a late goal securing their 3-1 victory over Olympiakos.\n\nGerrards has emphasized his desire to stay at Liverpool long-term, despite Chelsea's renewed bids. He mentioned he could win everything he wants with them but also stressed they needed him for more games. Benitez believes Gerrards can achieve all that without moving teams, appreciating his leadership and strength. Both teams focus on building on wins rather than resting on a single success.\n\nSummary: Liverpool keep their manager and aim to build on wins.
