{"raw_text": "Safin plays down Wimbledon hopes\n \n Newly-crowned Australian Open champion Marat Safin has ruled out any chance of winning Wimbledon in the future.\n \n After losing in round one last year, Safin said he had \"given up\" on Wimbledon and winning his second Grand Slam title has not changed his mind. \"I'll play, but with no expectations. I feel like I can't waste my time, my energy on that surface,\" he said. \"Some people, they cannot play on clay. Some people, they cannot play on a hard court. Me, I can't play on grass.\" However, Safin is hopeful that winning the Australian Open will give him the belief he needs to win more Grand Slam titles. \"It's a relief for me. Two grand slams, it's already something. But with this one I worked really hard for it,\" he said. \"Basically, I would love to win a couple more. I think I have a chance if I continue this way.\n \n \"If (coach) Peter Lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer, I think I can make it.\" The 25-year-old shocked Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final to win his first major title but then lost in two Australian Open finals. Safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another Grand Slam. \"I didn't expect that (to win the 2000 US Open) - it was against Sampras, I wasn't the favourite so I had no pressure whatsoever,\" he said. \"After the first final that I didn't win against Thomas Johansson (in 2002), I couldn't see myself winning the Grand Slams anymore. \"I was once in the semi-finals of the French Open, but I didn't believe I can win it. \"I just couldn't handle the pressure. You need to believe in yourself, and I didn't.\"\n \n And after losing the first set 6-1 to Lleyton Hewitt in Sunday's final, Safin said he began to doubt himself again. \"I am 25. I'm playing against Hewitt. At least you have to have the opportunity to win it, at least have a chance,\" he said. \"It's like you go there and you lose first set 6-1, then you start to think: 'This is not my day. The way I'm playing is ridiculous.' \"But then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there. \"And I found it. I was like really much I was much happier than in 2000, that's for sure, because I get over it.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Marat Safin has ruled out winning Wimbledon in the future after losing in round one last year.

The user provided a detailed summary already, but I'm supposed to come up with my own concise version without any explanations or formatting. Let me break down what each part is saying.\n\nFirst, the main point is that Safin has ruled out playing in Wimbledon again because he lost last year's match. He admitted he doesn't plan on winning any future Grand Slam titles after losing in round one. That\u2019s his stance on tennis.\n\nThen, there are some quotes where he talks about not having expectations when facing clay courts, which makes sense since he plays on hard surfaces. He mentions that while he won two major tournaments (Australian Open and US Open), it was unexpected for him to win another Grand Slam. That's a bit of a shift from his previous achievements.\n\nHe also talks about his past experiences with other titles. For instance, in the US Open 2000, he didn't face any pressure because Sampras was the favorite. But when he lost that set against Hewitt, he started doubting himself again. He realized that losing a set makes him question if he can continue winning, especially on clay courts.\n\nHe says after the US Open, he felt better because he had to handle more pressure. In other tournaments, like the French Open, he once was in the semi-finals but didn't believe he could win it. So he realized he needed to be more confident and open to improve.\n\nIn summary, Safin is trying to rebuild his confidence after losing two top tournaments. He lost some matches on clay, which gave him a chance to start doubting himself again. After that loss, he felt a bit better about continuing to play at Wimbledon.\n</think>\n\nmarat safin ruled out winning Wimbledon after losing last year's match. he believes not winning any Grand Slam titles is his priority now. he admitted not planning on winning after losing in round one of the tournament. in some matches on clay courts, he felt unprepared, but on hard surfaces like tennis courts, he could play without expectations. he lost the 2000 US Open to pete sampras, expecting no pressure due to him being the favorite. after that loss, he began doubting himself again, realizing losing a set was a step toward rebuilding his confidence. in other tournaments, like the french open, he once faced semi-finals but didn't believe in winning. ultimately, he felt better after losing the 2000 US Open and started to feel more confident than then.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "In an interview with Australian media outlet The Daily Telegraph, World No. 1 tennis player Marat Safin has discussed his future aspirations and his thoughts on the possibility of winning the Australian Open.
