Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the main event is a Heineken Cup tie against Biarritz on April 3rd. It's being moved to Real Sociedad's stadium in San Sebastian instead of their previous home, Paseo de Anoeta. Okay, so that changes the location for both teams and fans.\n\nI notice that Real Sociedad has a bigger stadium with 32,000 seats compared to Biarritz's only 12,667. That's a significant difference in capacity. They're giving at least 8,000 tickets, so maybe they have a backup plan if the main game doesn't sell out.\n\nThe text mentions that this is the first Heineken Cup match in Spain since Real did it in 1998 when they played against Ulster. That adds context about why they're moving the game to Spain\u2014likely because they want more attendance or better hosting.\n\nThe other important point is that Real was last an Irish team at Paseo de Anoeta, having last faced them during a pre-season in 1998. So this switch makes sense for them as well.\n\nIn terms of key ideas, the main points are: switch location to Spanish Stadium; change in venue and capacity; Real getting a larger crowd with backup tickets; first Heineken Cup match in Spain since last home game; Real being last Irish team at Paseo de Anoeta. These points need to be included concisely in the summary.\n\nI should keep it plain text without explanations or any formatting. Just the summary as a sentence or two, making sure each key point is included clearly.\n</think>\n\nThe Heineken Cup quarter-final between Munster and Biarritz on April 3 will switch venue to Real Sociedad's Paseo de Anoeta Stadium in San Sebastian. Real has a capacity of 32,000, while Biarritz's Parc des Sports Aguilera can only hold 12,667. Real's team is guaranteed at least 8,000 tickets.
