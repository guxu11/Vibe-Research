Let me read through it again.\n\nPavey focuses on indoor success, which is good because she likes that. She's missing January's view from Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on the European Indoor Championships in March. That makes sense since cross country can be both fun and competitive, so focusing on indoor training could help her get better physically before competing internationally.\n\nShe was third last week in the European Championships but prefers to race on the track. She's 31 years old and mentions that winning bronze wasn't bad, but she worries about injuries. She doesn't like running up hills because of previous injuries. She mentioned winning a team silver medal at the Athens Olympics and helping her team win that region. So, I think she has some solid achievements to build on.\n\nPavey came fifth in a 5k at the Olympics and helped her team win last week's Europes under the threat.
