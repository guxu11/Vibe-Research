The user has provided a detailed text about two football managers, Hitzlsperger and O'Leary, at Aston Villa.

He mentions that while he's considering staying at Villa, there's interest from Hamburg, so he might need assurances O'Leary will continue working long-term. He also wants his backroom staff (Aitken and McGregor) to get deals tied to the club.\n\nI notice some repetition in the text: O'Leary says Hitzlsperger is waiting, which ties into the future contract issue.
