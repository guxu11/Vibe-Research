Let me read through the provided text carefully.\n\nThe main points are that Hong Kong is hoping to join Japan as co-hosts of the World Cup. Japan has applied on its own but wants to host it as part of their rugby tradition, which hasn't been done in the past. There's confusion about whether they should take over the traditional sports areas like the ground or host a separate pool and quarter-final. The Hong Kong Rugby Football Union (HKRFU) chairman, John Molloy, says they're considering hosting by themselves but haven't received formal approval yet. He adds that without a definitive proposal, they can't make other decisions.\n\nThe JRFU secretary, Koji Tokumasu, notes that Japan is competing with South Africa and New Zealand for the spot. They've been preparing since before the tournament started, which suggests a lot of planning and effort. The World Cup has been held in the Six Nations or Tri-Nations system before, but Japan hasn't yet transitioned to it. The International Rugby Board (IRB) thinks this is time to make rugby global.\n\nJapan is ready to host, especially since they've already organized their first professional rugby league with 125,508 players and led the top rankings after last year's tournament. They aim to integrate into the international scene for a successful World Cup. South Korea was also involved in the 2002 Co-Hosting World Cup, which helped Japan succeed there.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Hong Kong is considering hosting the 2011 Rugby World Cup as one of their pools and a quarter-final after not having formal approval yet. They need to get a proposal in place before making other decisions.\n</think>\n\nHong Kong is considering hosting the 2011 Rugby World Cup as part of its own program, needing formal approval from its Rugby Football Union (HKRFU). This decision follows Japan's application for hosting, though they have requested to join in their efforts, not necessarily as co-hosts. They need a definitive proposal to proceed with hosting by themselves or in a separate pool and quarter-final. Their transition to the traditional sports areas hasn't been completed yet, making this move crucial. The International Rugby Board (IRB) sees rugby as a potential global movement. Japan aims to host, having organized their first professional league, which placed them at the top rankings globally. This includes South Korea's involvement in the 2002 Co-Hosting World Cup.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "Hong Kong in 2011 World Cup bid\nHong Kong is hoping to join Japan as co-host of the 2011 RuGBY World Cup.
