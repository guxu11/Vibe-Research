Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, there's Adriano who is Chelsea. His agent, Gilmar Rinaldi, says he hasn't had any contact with Chelsea over a striker. That's interesting because usually, agents have some form of business relationship with the team they represent, so this might be something unusual.\n\nThen, Chelsea reported that they were making inquiries about Inter Milan's 22-year-old Brazilian star. I think that means they're looking to sign someone from there. Rinaldi told BBC Sport in Rio: \"I can assure you Chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or Adriano.\" So Chelsea isn't directly involved, but they are interested indirectly.\n\nParma and Real Madrid seem interested but not new. They already have some interest in him, which might mean he's a good candidate. Their focus is on maintaining that position rather than trying to upgrade them.\n\nAdriano has scored 14 goals in his last 20 appearances. That shows he's had some success, but in terms of the league, it seems limited because he was just over a year ago from Parma and now joins Chelsea. Maybe he's not as strong as he used to be?\n\nChelsea boss Jose Mourinho claims he was in Milan talking with Adriano about something. He mentions that if they want him, they can practice their Portuguese with him, but maybe they don't need strikers. That might mean there could be some tension or uncertainty.\n\nRinaldi told BBC Sport: \"I have to say Chelsea have had no contact with me.\" If Chelsea isn't directly involved, why are they interested? Maybe he's a free agent or can negotiate terms with them later on.\n\nInter reported a \u00a340m price tag for Adriano, joining Parma over a year ago. Real Madrid thought he would be a natural replacement for Ronaldo but Rinaldi said they couldn't give Inter's price because it would need to be negotiated.\n\nSo putting this all together, the key points are:\n- Rinaldi insists Chelsea isn't involved.\n- Chelsea is interested indirectly through Inter.\n- Parma and Real Madrid have a history of interest but aren't new.\n- Adriano has some success but hasn't reached the top.\n- Mourinho mentions potential uncertainty with Chelsea's decision-making.\n\nI need to make sure all these points are included in the summary without adding any extra details. I'll focus on the main actions and statements from each section, keeping it concise.\n</think>\n\nRinaldi insists Chelsea isn't involved with Adriano. Chelsea is interested indirectly through Inter.
