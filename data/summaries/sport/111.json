Mourinho, who plays Chelsea this week against Barcelona and Liverpool, mentioned that his substitutions include those players who missed because of the injury.\n\nThen it talks about other injuries: Gallas and Duff from France and Ireland were injured in the closing stages of a 1-0 loss to St James' Park. Cudicini got a red card but isn't playing against Barcelona yet, so he won't play in the Champions League final either. The manager is probably considering a rotation with Bridge out, maybe not adding new players.\n\nCelestine Babayaro left the club in January for Newcastle and hasn't fit in there, though Gallas has been at left-back before but struggling. Sometimes Paulo Ferreira from right-back might switch to left-back, which could mean someone else is there. There are options for young players like Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan, or Sam Tillen. But it's unlikely Mourinho would take on a tried-out prospect in the Champions League.\n\nBridge's injury means Mourinho won't have a specialist at left-back during the season, even though he wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, who might be ready later. Shearer is unsure what caused Bridge's injury, but it was \"shameful.\"\n\nThe manager's team is chasing three trophies, lost Arjen Robben to serious injury earlier, and Chelsea still has other injuries.\n\nI need to make sure I include all key points: who could miss, Gallas and Duff's status, Cudicini's situation, the manager's plan, and what else is happening with Celestine and Ferreira.\n</think>\n\nChelsea could miss the rest of the season if Wayne Bridge, an English international at 24, misses due to a broken ankle.
