He told BBC Sport: \"It's potentially the most fearsome line-up I've ever come up against. They're awesome. \"But I'd back us all the way to beat them when they come over.\" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month.\n \n When Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: \"He'd be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. \"Don't get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I'm sure there are some of them who'll make the Lions Test XV. \"But you can't disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they've scored have been great. I'll admit it'll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O'Driscoll.\"\n \n Umaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side.
