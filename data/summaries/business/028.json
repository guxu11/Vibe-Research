This happened after China and other Asian countries saw higher demand than expected.\n\nThen, the prices went up by $1.64 on Thursday, reaching $47.10, and Brent crude rose similarly. There was a drop in US crude stockpiles, from around 300 million to 294 million. This could be due to supply issues from North America during a cold spell.\n\nEarlier, the US energy market saw gains on Wednesday after supply decreases due to colder areas. Additionally, concerns about Yukos, a struggling Russian company, caused further price adjustments.\n\nOrin Middleton from Barclays pointed out that prices might have set new lows around $40-$50 per barrel and warned against overreaching expectations, suggesting the prices could stabilize or fall again.\n\nI should capture all these points without adding extra details.
