{"raw_text": "S Korean consumers spending again\n \n South Korea looks set to sustain its revival thanks to renewed private consumption, its central bank says.\n \n The country's economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers' credit card spending spree. Card use fell sharply last year, but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year. \"The economy is now heading upward rather than downward,\" said central bank governor Park Seung. \"The worst seems to have passed.\" Mr Park's statement came as the bank decided to keep interest rates at an all-time low of 3.25%. It had cut rates in November to help revive the economy, but rising inflation - reaching 0.7% month-on-month in January - has stopped it from cutting further. Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. Other indicators are also suggesting that the country is inching back towards economic health. Exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in Asian economies - grew slower in January than at any time in 17 months. But domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack. Consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in January, and retail sales were up 2.1% in December. Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003. One of its biggest card issuers, LG Card, was rescued from collapse in December, having almost imploded under the weight of its customers' bad debts.

It talks about South Korea's economy, mentioning personal debt issues due to increased credit card spending. The central bank's statement by Seung Park is crucial here because it indicates they're keeping rates low despite rising inflation. That shows economic health is a bit shaky but not entirely in despair.\n\nThe summary needs to capture the main points: continued revival with private consumption, rising spending after initial drops due to high debt, the need for rate cuts only if prices start rising, and the recovery from low consumer confidence and falling sales despite some defaults on cards. Also, mentions that LG Card was rescued and the government's efforts to manage the card glut.\n\nI should make sure each of these points is included but in a concise manner.
