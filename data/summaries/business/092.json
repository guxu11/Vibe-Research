The firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in Israel, although like almost all GSM operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with Israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there. The two countries strengthened ties in both defence and economic issues in 2004. Israeli industry minister Ehud Olmert was reported in June to have attended a meeting between Ruhi Dogusoy, Turkcell's chief operating officer, and executives from Israeli telecoms firms. Telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments, passed earlier in September. The other is airports, a source of controversy after the army closed Tehran's new Imam Khomeini International Airport on its opening day in May 2004. Again, the allegation was that the part-Turkish TAV consortium which built and ran it had links with Israel.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Iranian MPs have threatened to cut Turkey's stake in a $3bn deal to build an Iranian mobile network after parliament approved a ruling on foreign investment deals, citing alleged business ties with Israel as a security risk.", "llama3.2:3b": "Iranian MPs are threatening to slash Turkcell's stake in a $3bn mobile deal from 70% to 49%, potentially forcing the Turkish firm to bail out of the project due to allegations of business ties with Israel, sparking concerns over security risks and foreign investment vetoes.", "gemma2:2b": "Iranian MPs are threatening to block a $3 billion mobile network deal by cutting Turkcell's stake from 70% to 49%.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that Iranian MPs are threatening a mobile deal. They've slashed their stake in the project, which is supposed to build a new network in Iran. The deal was worth $3 billion in 2017, but now they're reducing it to $1.6 billion.\n\nNext, the Turkey's largest private mobile firm, Turkcell, has already given themselves a veto over foreign investment deals after they were involved with Israel. Now they say they'll give up on this deal entirely because their stake is too high\u201470% instead of 49%.\n\nTurkcell's main competitor, Irancell, signed the contract in September for $180 instead of the original $500 price tag. But there was a parliamentary commission that ruled their controlling stake is too high. They warned that Turkcell is a security risk because of business ties with Israel.\n\nThe government is dominated by religious conservatives and will vote on this deal tomorrow. They're worried about how the reduction in stake would affect the project's financial consolidation, making it more risky.\n\nTurkcell didn't comment on whether they have any business links with Israel yet. However, their deal has some cross-border connections since 2004, which helped Irancell. There were also reports about ties with Israeli telecom firms for Irancell and TAV. This controversy happened after the army closed Tehran's airport.\n\nOverall, the summary needs to capture the key points: MPs threatening the deal, reduction in stake, risk of reducing it too much, financial issues, government decision deadline, concerns about security risks, business connections from 2004.\n</think>\n\nThe Iranian government has announced that its largest private mobile firm, Turkcell, is threatening a $3 billion deal for building a new network in Iran. The government has slashed its stake in the project, reducing it to 70% instead of 49%. Meanwhile, Turkey's public carrier, Irancell, signed the contract for $180 million, which was previously set at $500 million. The parliamentary committee ruled that Turkcell's controlling stake is too high due to potential business risks with Israel. The government will vote on this decision tomorrow, following concerns about financial consolidation and security risks.

Turkcell has warned that the proposed change in control could make it difficult for it to consolidate Irancell and risk being seen as risky due to business ties with Israel.

The issue has raised concerns over the security risk posed by Turkish-Israeli business ties and prompted Parliament to vote on whether to reduce Turkcell's control or postpone the deal altogether.
