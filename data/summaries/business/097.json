{"raw_text": "'Strong dollar' call halts slide\n \n The US dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was \"in America's interest\".\n \n But analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant. They also pointed out that positive comments apart, President George W Bush's administration had done little to stop the dollar's slide. A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November. Against the Japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.\n \n Policy makers in Europe have called the dollar's slide \"brutal\" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. However, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro's rise at a monthly meeting of Eurozone ministers late on Monday. Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. Mr Snow who is currently in Dublin at the start of a four-nation EU visit, has applauded Ireland's introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. \"The eurozone is growing below its potential. When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,\" he said. Mr Snow's comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.\n \n \"Our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,\" he explained. \"Markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.\" US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine. Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy. Domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by President Bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (\u00a3230bn). The current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. For many analysts, a weaker dollar is here to stay. \"No end is in sight,\" said Carsten Fritsch, a strategist at Commerzbank . \"It is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.\" Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "The US dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was \"in America's interest\".

Analysts are optimistic about positive comments from President Bush but warn that little can be done to prevent the dollar's slide further. Some EU policymakers have called for measures to counter the strong dollar, while others believe it is too late to reverse its impact. The US economy remains weaker than expected due to factors such as a growing deficit and rising unemployment.

While policy makers in Europe criticized the dollar's slide, Snow's comments praised Ireland's economic reforms but stressed that open markets should determine exchange rates.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says that the US dollar has halted its slide against the euro and yen after John Snow, the Treasury Secretary, mentioned the strong dollar is in America's interest. That's a key point. But then analysts note that while there were some gains, they might not be long-term because the US economy still faces issues.\n\nNext, it talks about the economic situation, noting problems but not much stopping the slide yet. President George W Bush's administration didn't do much to stop it either. So, both the strong dollar and the US government's economic policies aren't enough.\n\nThe part about the dollar being weaker against the yen is interesting too. Against the euro, the dollar was at 1.2944, just below its previous record of 1.3006. Against the yen, it's at 105.28, which is higher than the seven-month low of 105.17. So, stronger against the euro and weaker against the yen.\n\nPolicy makers in Europe are calling the dollar \"brutal\" because the euro's strength has damped economic growth there. But it's unclear if European ministers will declare something to stop the euro rising next week. Higher growth by other EU countries could help reduce the US deficit.\n\n snow, who is on a visit, praised Ireland's measures like lower taxes and deregulation, which helped boost growth. His comments might have partly stopped the dollar, but he said things are still uncertain.\n\nEconomists agree that the US economy's fundamentals (like consumer demand) are down, and spending by Bush is pushing the deficit to record levels. The current account deficit hasn't closed yet. Analysts think a weaker dollar could continue forever, with some saying the US is secretly benefiting from it.\n\nPutting this all together, the main points are: the dollar is still in a slide but analyst expectations say it might end soon; both stronger against euro and weaker against yen; European concern about economic growth being damped; policy measures by governments; and economists' views on continued weakness of the dollar.\n</think>\n\nThe US dollar's strength against the euro and yen has halted its decline, with analysts cautioning that any gains may be short-lived. The dollar is still trading just below its 2013 record levels against the euro but near one. Against the yen, it's slightly stronger. Policy makers in Europe are warning of a brutal move due to the euro's strength, while doubts remain about whether ministers will declare action. Higher growth elsewhere could help reduce the US deficit. Snow praised Ireland's reforms and saw gains, though he emphasized economic uncertainty.

European policymakers have expressed concern over the euro's strength, which they blame for slowing economic growth, but it is unclear if they will take action. Snow, visiting Europe, emphasized the need for higher European growth to help address the US deficit. While he defended market-driven exchange rates, US officials argue that global growth should not rely solely on the US.
