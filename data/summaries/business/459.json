{"raw_text": "'Golden economic period' to end\n \n Ten years of \"golden\" economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly, City consultancy Deloitte has warned.\n \n The UK economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown's forecast of 3% to 3.5%. It also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.\n \n In its quarterly economic review, Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed a \"golden period\" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.\n \n But it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major \"imbalances\" in the economy. Deloitte's chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: \"The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. \"Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.\"\n \n Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte believes. Gordon Brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, the firm claims. This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%. However, Deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. It expects a series of \"aggressive\" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. \"Although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the UK economy,\" Mr Bootle.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "The US-based Deloitte consultancy has warned that the current economic growth period is ending in 2005 with an expected slowdown.

First, I'll read through the entire text carefully to understand the key points.\n\nSo, the article starts by warning that the \"golden\" economic performance could end in 2005 because growth would slow down. It mentions City consultancy Deloitte advising against this. Then it talks about the UK economy's reaction to a slowdown due to the housing market: consumer spending falling and unemployment increasing. They predict a 2% growth rate for this year, below the forecast of 3% by Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\n\nDeloitte points out that they had a \"golden period\" in the past decade with low unemployment and low inflation, but it was due to significant economic imbalances created by the housing market slowdown. They also mention Roger Bootle saying the biggest hit is from the housing market already slowing down. On the flip side, household spending growth has been robust, likely to drop as the housing market slows.\n\nThe article then talks about future economic constraints. Increased household budget pressures and rising taxes could slow growth. They estimate a $10 billion increase in public finances per year for the short term, which would cause a slowdown from last year's 3.25% growth. However, they expect moderate inflation even if prices don't fall.\n\nThey also mention that financial regulations will likely cut borrowing costs by raising interest rates to around 4%, leading to more aggressive cuts over two years. They warn about the Bank of England needing to respond quickly, maybe with a 3.5% rate in 2006. The conclusion is that while growth might be slow in 2005 and 2006, it's likely a start of a tougher period.\n\nNow, putting this together into a concise summary without explanations or formatting.\n</think>\n\nThe UK economy is expected to face challenges after the \"golden\" economic performance from the past decade. Growth may slow due to increased household budget pressures and rising taxes, predicted by Deloitte, which aims for a 2% growth rate compared to last year's 3.25%. However, they expect moderate inflation and potential price increases despite slower growth. The economy is likely to experience stronger household spending growth earlier but slows as the housing market slows.
