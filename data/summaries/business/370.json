Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst sentence: US manufacturing expands. That means it's getting stronger, probably with more jobs or higher production.\n\nNext line: ISM survey showed increased industrial production in December. They called it a rise of 58.6 from 57.8. Since it's above 50, that's good news for growth.\n\nThen, they say the growth was driven by \"significant\" new orders, specifically \"the rise in new orders.\" That suggests the market is picking up quickly.\n\nNext point: It's the 19th consecutive month of expansion, which is impressive. The chairman mentions the year is strong because of these numbers.\n\nThe ISM index for manufacturing includes responses from more than 400 companies\u2014textile, chemicals, paper\u2014and it's been above 50 since June 2003. That's a good timeframe to look at the performance over time.\n\nAnalysts expected December's figure to be around 58.1, but this is higher. They're expecting a small increase in prices and maybe slower growth now because of rising prices? Or perhaps businesses are getting more efficient? The employment index went down by 6 to 52.7 from 57.6, which could mean more workers are being hired or people leaving.\n\nThen the \"prices paid\" index dropped again, going down by another 2 points to 72.0 from 74.0. That makes sense if prices are rising\u2014more expensive inputs would cost businesses more.\n\nSo putting it all together: US manufacturing is strong with expansion, driven by new orders, and despite higher costs and slower growth now, the overall picture shows positive trends over the past year.\n</think>\n\nUS manufacturing shows signs of strong expansion with industrial production rising in December at 58.6 compared to 57.8 last month. Growth was driven by a significant rise in new orders, indicating quicker picking up of demand.
