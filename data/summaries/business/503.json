They even saw a 70% increase in net profit, which was impressive. Their sales also grew significantly, 27% compared to last year. But I need to focus on key ideas.\n\nMaruti accounts for half the domestic car sales in India, making them popular with consumers. The economy's state is good enough that public transport and car ownership are low, which helps keep prices down. They beat market expectations despite rising costs, partly due to cost-cutting measures. Their profit from third-quarter sales went up by 17.8%, including vans and utility vehicles.\n\nMahindra is another company benefiting with a 52% increase in profits. But I don't think Maruti is the only one; other companies like Mahindra are doing well too. The overall economy's good growth gives consumers more money to spend, which supports their sales figures.\n\nI need to condense this into a concise summary without adding any extra details or explanations.
