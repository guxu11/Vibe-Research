Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nFirst, Diageo is the largest spirits company in the world and they're considering buying a US-based wine firm called Chalone for around $260 million. The deal is all-cash, no shares involved, which makes sense because Diageo has done that before with other companies like Viagre.\n\nI remember Diageo's main brands are Smirnoff vodka and Guinness, but they have a US winemaking arm called Diageo Chateau & Estate Wines. They expect this deal to be approved by US regulators in the first quarter of 2005. That sounds good because Diageo is already strong in the US market.\n\nDiageo's president, Ivan Menezes, talked about the US wine market being a growth opportunity due to good demographics and consumption trends. He also mentioned that despite the weaker dollar, which usually hurts companies, Diageo had lower turnover compared to before when they might have been doing better. They reported \u00a38.89 billion in turnover down from \u00a39.28 billion last year, so it seems like it's not doing as well as expected.\n\nAt the end of 2003, Chalone made $69.4 million in revenue. So Diageo is acquiring a company that was smaller in the US market before this deal happened.\n\nI need to make sure I include all these points: Diageo buying Chalone for $260M, the acquisition type (all-cash), US winemaking arm, regulatory approval timeline, Diageo's financials, and Menezes' comments on the market trends. Also, note that despite lower turnover in the past, Diageo expects to improve this year.\n\nI think that covers everything the user provided. I should make sure it's concise but includes all key details without adding extra fluff.\n</think>\n\nDiageo has announced an all-cash acquisition of Chalone, a US-based wine firm, valued at $260 million. Diageo expects regulatory approval for the deal by the end of the first quarter of 2005 and plans to integrate Chalone into its US wine business. With a strong US market presence through Diageo's Chateau & Estate Wines, Diageo reported a \u00a38.89 billion turnover in 2004, down from \u00a39.28 billion the previous year, influenced by the weaker dollar.
