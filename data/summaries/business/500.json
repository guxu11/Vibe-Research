Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.\n\nFirst, the text talks about Eurotunnel seeing sales drop because of low-cost airlines taking over. The revenue was down 4% in 2004 with \u20ac789m. They mention that no-frills airlines are making a strong impression, especially in Europe.\n\nThen, Eurotunnel's cross-Channel truck market is improving, but not fully benefiting because most traffic goes to ports via containers. Passenger trains run by another company called Eurostar. There are debts exceeding \u20ac6bn, and the company is being kept afloat by 200 banks.
