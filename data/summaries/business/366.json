{"raw_text": "WMC says Xstrata bid is too low\n \n Australian mining firm WMC Resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 7.4bn Australian dollar ($5.8bn; \u00a33bn) bid by rival Xstrata.\n \n There is now pressure on Swiss-based Xstrata to increase its takeover offer. A report from investment firm Grant Samuel in WMC defence documents values WMC shares at A$7.17 to A$8.24, against Xstrata's bid of A$6.35 a share. Analysts said the defence documents provided more details on WMC, and may trigger a possible rival bid. \"If a bid is going to emerge it is probably likely in the next one to two weeks,\" said Daiwa Securities analyst Mark Pervan. He said the valuation would put increased pressure on Xstrata to look at \"sweetening\" its offer. Marc Gonsalves, an executive at Xstrata, said: \"We will review the information contained in the target's statement over the next week or so.\" He added: \"While we will review the assumptions made by Grant Samuel in detail, we are extremely sceptical of their conclusion, and suggest that WMC shareholders take extreme care in presuming that these optimistic assumptions are capable of being realised.\"\n \n Last month Australia's competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of WMC by Zurich and London-based Xstrata.

And WMC chief executive Andrew Michelmore claimed the Xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for Xstrata's shareholders, and was not being made for the benefit of WMC's shareholders. Grant Samuel said its valuation of WMC was based on lower average prices for nickel, copper and uranium than current market levels. \"Any longer term commodity price improvements would only improve our outlook,\" Mr Michelmore said.\n \n In 2003 Xstrata acquired Australia's largest copper miner - MIM Holdings. WMC Resources is the world's third-largest producer of concentrated nickel, and also a miner of copper and uranium. It owns the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia, which contains about one-third of the world's known uranium resources and is also the world's fourth largest copper mine.

Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.\n\nFirst paragraph says that WMC is considering a bid from Xstrata, which is worth up to 30% more than their $5.8 billion offer. That's significant because if Xstrata wants to increase its offer, it might pressure them further.\n\nNext, there's a report by Grant Samuel in WMC's defense documents showing that WMC shares are valued at about $7.17 to $8.24, while Xstrata's bid is around $6.35. This suggests WMC has a higher valuation but needs more info before moving forward.\n\nThe analyst Mark Pervan from Daiwa Securities mentions that the defense documents provide details which might lead to a possible rival bid in the next couple of weeks. He thinks increased pressure on Xstrata to get \"sweetened\" deal makes sense because they're looking for better terms, maybe to retain control.\n\n Marc Gonsalves at Xstrata also says he'll review Grant Samuel's info over the next week or so but is skeptical about their conclusion and prefers WMC shares to be taken seriously. He thinks it's more important to get good terms from Xstrata than protecting their own interests.\n\nThen, last month Australia's watchdog said they'd oppose Xstrata taking WMC over Zurich and London. But on Tuesday, WMC's chairman Tommie Bergman stated that directors think WMC is better off rejecting the offer because shareholders are in its best interest. He mentions WMC will focus on value-creating options from a portfolio of \"world-class assets.\" WMC's CEO Andrew Michelmore says Xstrata's offer aims to create value for their own shareholders, not WMC's.\n\nLastly, Xstrata was acquired by WMC Resources in 2003 when they owned the largest copper miner. WMC now has nickel, copper, and uranium mines, among others. There are growing businesses in gold, lead, and silver too.\n\nPutting this together, I need to create a concise summary that captures all these points: WMC's consideration of Xstrata's high bid, Xstrata's defense documents showing higher valuation, potential pressure on their offer, analyst views on possible rival bids, director concerns about rejecting the offer, Xstrata aiming for value gains over WMC, and some historical context.\n\nI need to make sure I include all these elements without adding extra details. So, the summary should mention WMC's bid being up to 30% more, Xstrata's defense documents with higher valuations, the potential pressure on their offer, analysts' views about possible rival bids, directors' concerns, Xstrata's focus on value gains, and their historical acquisition.\n\nI think that covers everything in the text without getting into too much detail. Now I just need to put it all together as a single, clear sentence.\n</think>\n\nWMC Resources is considering a high bid from rival Xstrata, potentially up to 30% more than their $5.8 billion offer, supported by defense documents showing WMC's shares valued at around $7.17 to $8.24, while Xstrata's offer of $6.35 per share.
