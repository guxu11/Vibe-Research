The move is aimed at defeating investors who opposed its bid for the London Stock Exchange on the day of its launch.\n\nCritics have expressed concerns about the potential return of money invested in the exchange, particularly given that it now provides funds to fundraise against the ongoing economic slowdowns and increased trading activity. Despite this, Deutsche Boerse said profit had been in the three months to 31 December, upholding a record-breaking dividend payout of approximately $158.8m (approximately \u00a383.3m) for the year.\n\nDeutsche Boerse's sales have also risen significantly since its launch, leading to elevated revenue figures from 1.45bn euros to 364.4m euros, reflecting increased trading activity and growth in the market.\n\nFurthermore, Deutsche Boerse is offering a bid worth an estimated $1.3bn (approximately $2.48bn; approximately 1.88bn euros) for the London Stock Exchange in Frankfurt, which is a major hub of the German stock market. The move was announced to draw attention from investors who are currently facing stiff competition and slow economic pace.\n\nIn terms of dividend payments, Deutsche Boerse has shifted from an initial 55 euro cents to 70 euro cents payment, reflecting a further boost compared to the previous one of 55 euro cents. While this increase may be offset by a positive perception that the bid will pay off its debts, investors are still reluctant due to concerns about potential default risks.\n\nTo conclude, while Deutsche Boerse is seeking to capitalize on its strong financial performance and market positioning, it remains cautious about how it allocates its resources for dividend payments. The move is seen as an investment opportunity aimed at defending against the tumultuous conditions imposed by trading activity and easing competition in the market.\n", "smollm:1.7b": "The summary should preserve key ideas and details:\n\n1.
