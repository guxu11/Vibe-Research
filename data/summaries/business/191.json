{"raw_text": "US regulator to rule on pain drug\n \n US food and drug regulators will decide on Friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.\n \n The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days. The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx. Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval. The FDA has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks.\n \n Putting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug, analysts said.\n \n Merck voluntarily stopped sales of Vioxx on 30 September, a move which caused the firm's fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $1.1bn (\u00a3581m), from $1.4bn a year earlier. Merck's shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of Vioxx-related litigation. Alarm bells were rung by a research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months. The Cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including Merck and Pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.\n \n Pfizer is still selling its Celebrex and Bextra products, though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart. Merck's announcement of a possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise. Merck's head of research Peter Kim said that it withdrew Vioxx \"based on the information that was available to us at the time, knowing there were alternative therapies\". He went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports. \"Given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US,\" Mr Kim explained.\n \n On Thursday, David Graham from the FDA's Office of Drug Safety told the advisory panel that \"there really doesn't appear to be a need for Cox-2\" inhibitors. According to calculations presented to the US Senate by Dr Graham in November, Vioxx may be linked to as many as to 56,000 American deaths. Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case, the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. European regulators, meanwhile, ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take Cox-2 inhibitors. The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be \"cautious\" about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "US regulator will decide whether to recommend the sale of painkillers called COX-2 inhibitors, which are linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.

The company's decision may be announced on Friday after hearing evidence for three days.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gives its verdict. After considering various evidence, the analysts ruled favorably for the increased risks given their use cases. Users who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take the drugs due to potential risk factors. They are advised to \"cautiously\" prepare patients by giving them the drug.\n\nThe Celebrex and Bextra products from Merck were released after being withdrawn from shops last year, making them suitable for retailing. According to research, these products may cause users to experience fewer stomach problems compared to other painkillers.\n\nMerck's voluntary decision on 30 September was a move which shifted the company's quarterly earnings from negative balance to profit. The shares had risen by around 10% due to favorable news and Merck's profits were set back to help overcome its debt obligations, which were upturned because of lawsuits against it in the past.\n\nOn an overall basis, the analysis showed that Vioxx was linked with heart attack and stroke risks more frequently than other painkillers. The increased risk could lead to complications including stomach discomfort, complications from heart disease, etc., therefore, offering a unique advantage as they might reduce adverse side effects compared to traditional painkillers.\n\nMerck's decision on reintroducing Vioxx sparked excitement among analysts. They were unsure about the legal battles with people claiming to have been injured by the drug and concluded that these cases are not severe enough to need new legal battles. The company has also been forced to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of litigation related to Vioxx-related lawsuits.\n\nThe decision also prompted increased alarms and research reports on the potential risk of heart attack and stroke for patients who have taken the drug. According to the findings, a high-risk patient's risk is about 56,000 in the US. The company has been scrutinized by Europe's regulatory bodies which suggested that doctors should be cautious about giving the drugs to those who are at high risk.\n\nThe decision has led to an independent body named the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) overseeing the safety of the drug, a move which could potentially open up new market opportunities for Merck's products. The company\u2019s decision also provided evidence to the US Senate on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place.\n", "smollm:1.7b": "The US regulator will decide on Friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.

Their shares dropped more than 10%, needing to set aside money on litigation costs. A research note showed heart attack and stroke risks doubled for patients taking it for at least 18 months.\n\nPfizer is still selling Celebrex and Bextra, but some say these might also be bad for hearts. Merck's decision to reintroduce Vioxx was surprising because Peter Kim said they didn't have the info, but things changed since new data came in. The FDA will create an independent body to assess safety, and EMA ruled against heart disease patients taking the drugs.\n\nSo putting it all together, I need to highlight that regulators are evaluating whether to recommend Vioxx for sale, the financial impact of selling Vioxx back, the risks from Vioxx in people's lives, the potential benefits for Merck despite the risks, and regulatory moves like creating an independent safety body and ruling against heart disease patients.\n</think>\n\nThe US regulator is deciding whether to recommend the sale of painkillers linked to high risk of heart attack or stroke.
