Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the key points.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that house prices fell further in November and property sales took longer because of rising interest rates. RICS found a 48% drop in prices for estate agents over three months, which is the highest in 12 years. They also noted that the number of sales dropped by 32%, averaging 22 per agent, with unsold properties rising to 67 on average. \n\nThe spokesperson from RICS, Ian Perry, said this slowdown gives buyers more power to negotiate but traditional market times aren't ideal for sales. He added that the UK's economy is healthy and interest rates didn't rise further, which helps in stabilizing confidence.\n\nOther countries like Germany, France, Italy, and Sweden also reported slower lending. The average asking price of a home fell by over \u00a3600 from \u00a3190k to \u00a3189k. In the UK, properties dropped the most in the Midlands and South but not as much in London, which still had lower prices. Scotland showed a steady rise despite prices being up.\n\nThey mentioned that sales are picking up again in January with 48% average sales, compared to 27% in December. The group is hoping for a quiet year starting in February, leading to 3% price growth over the next 12 months.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a concise summary without explanations or formatting. Let me list out the main points:\n\n- House prices fell due to slower sales and rising interest rates.\n- RICS found a significant drop (48%) in prices over three months.\n- Sales numbers went down by 32%, with unsold properties increasing.\n- Positive sentiment from RICS about still optimistic sales for this year.\n- International trends like Germany, France, etc., showed slower lending.\n- UK's biggest price drops were in the Midlands and South, not London.\n- Scotland had consistent price increases despite being up.\n- Sales are returning to higher levels in January, expected to see 48% average compared to 27% in December.\n- Aimed for a quiet start in February with potential for 3% growth.\n\nPutting this together without any extra details or explanations.
