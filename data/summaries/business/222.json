Companies like Exxon, Miner Highland Gold, and BP have reacted by refusing to participate. The Federal Natural Resources Agency said they're interested in letting Russian companies develop their strategic resources under Russia's competition law. They don't know exactly how it'll be done but suggest a case-by-case approach.\n\nThere are some key points: only at least 51% Russian-owned firms can bid, foreigners want free entry but the move isn't about ending the free market yet. Some countries have already been investing in Russia, like Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Observers think this shift could be important because of Russia's recent control change from Yukos under a stock market list.\n\n Analysts warn that it's still too early to make conclusions yet. Firms are still required to get more info before they react. BP and Exxon signed projects with Russian companies, but their deals seem valid even after Russia invited new offers.\n\nI should focus on the main reactions of major oil companies, the impact of the natural resources agency decision, the shift in foreign investment countries, and the warning about the timing of the move.\n</think>\n\nOil companies have faced cautious responses from Russia regarding foreign participation in their projects. Exxon, Miner Highland Gold, and BP declined to join new tenders for projects previously signed with Russia.

Observers note a shift in investment policies, with countries like Mexico and Saudi Arabia already supporting Russian investments, while some have requested Russia's involvement.

However, observers have noted that Russia's decision to protect national resources is not necessarily the end of the world and are unsure what to make of the collateral damage to foreign investment.
