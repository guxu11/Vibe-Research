The deal saw the sale of 11 billion euros (approx $14.4 billion; \u00a37.6 billion) of government bonds and later purchase of them back. This move was widely criticized, and now German regulator BaFin has reported evidence suggesting possible market manipulation. Citigroup is being questioned by authorities about potential penalties if the involved traders are found guilty. If charged, they could face five-year jail terms or fines. Under German law, prosecutors cannot pursue Citigroup itself but can handle probes to public officials.

The German regulatory authority also transferred the case to a public prosecutor in Frankfurt to continue the investigation and assess any potential consequences for Citigroup and its traders at the banking giant. The alleged manipulation occurred on August 2, 2017, when Citigroup sold $14.4bn worth of government bond sales in a few minutes before returning them later at a loss. However, Citigroup said it would continue to cooperate with authorities following the referral by BaFin and vowed to fully comply if investigated.
