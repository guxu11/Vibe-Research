However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs. Last year's growth rate of 6% can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence, the report said. According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems.

That means people aren't doing as well anymore.\n\nUnemployment is particularly high among young people\u201437% out of work versus 14% before. But there were some new jobs created last year, about 6% growth. However, during the first half of this year, economic losses were 22,000 jobs lost. So, it's not a sustained problem.\n\nThe report also mentions closures by Israel\u2014both border and internal\u2014causing economic issues because it restricts movement, slowing trade. They call these closures \"a key factor behind today's economic crisis.\"\n\nNigel Roberts from the World Bank says half of all Palestinians live below the poverty line, particularly vulnerable to shocks.
