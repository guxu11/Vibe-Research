The US filed a complaint against Brussels with the WTO over state aid to Airbus, prompting a retaliatory EU complaint over US support for Boeing. However, both sides agreed to suspend their requests for WTO arbitration at the beginning of December, to allow bilateral talks to continue.

The output should be plain text only. Hmm, let me read through the provided text carefully.\n\nThe text is about an EU-US meeting on ending subsidies for aircraft makers. It mentions Peter Mandelson from the EU Trade Commissioner announcing the agreement. Both sides are hoping to resolve the dispute between Airbus and Boeing over state aid they received. They cited each other as benefits of these subsidies, which were limited by 1992. The US filed a complaint with the WTO about state aid to Airbus, but both sides agreed to wait until December for WTO arbitration before starting talks.\n\nAlso, EADS and BAE Systems welcomed Mandelson's announcement, saying the issue should be discussed constructively rather than through legal means. Then there's UPS ordering more A380 planes after expanding their air freight capacity, cutting down on previous orders of smaller planes (90 to 53). They've already delivered 40 A300s.\n\nI need to make sure the summary captures all these points without extra details. Let me structure it: start with EU-US meeting announcement, then Mandelson's role, their hopes for a trade deal, the subsidies they accused of, the US's complaint, and the companies' reactions.
