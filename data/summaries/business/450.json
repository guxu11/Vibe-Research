Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst paragraph: Retail sales in December ended the year high with car sales strong. The seasonally adjusted sales rose by 1.2% compared to last month and jumped 8% for the year, better than previous highs from the late 90s. The increase was driven by auto sales up 4.3%, and dealers had to cut prices in a tough holiday shopping quarter.\n\nSecond paragraph: December sales pushed total spending to over $350 billion. Home furnishings also did well, up 2.2%. Non-store retailers saw modest growth of 1.9%. However, if we exclude car sales from December's data, retail sales were only up 0.3%, which is low for the year.\n\nThird paragraph: Retail sales are a big part of consumer spending, contributing two-thirds to US economic output. During 2001 and 2002, sales dipped but rebounded in recent years. Analysts expect stronger job growth through consumer spending as jobs improve. Unemployment numbers haven't improved yet; there were 367,000 claims since September, the highest in 2019.\n\nNow, I need to make a concise summary. Keep key points: December's strong sales, role of auto and home furnishings, employment trends, current Fed policy stance.\n</think>\n\nDecember saw robust retail sales growth with car sales leading the charge, driven by holiday shopping. Sales rose seasonally adjusted 1.2%, up 8% for the year, better than previous records. Auto sales surged 4.3% boosted by enhanced offers, and price cuts were necessary due to a challenging holiday season. Total spending from retail jumped $349 billion, while home furnishings and non-store retailers performed well with modest growth. Retail sales contribute two-thirds of US economic output.

The Commerce Department reported that seasonally adjusted retail sales increased by 1.2% in December compared to the 0.1% increase recorded in November. This surge in sales was driven by a notable rise in auto sales. Shopping during the holiday season was particularly strong, with December sales rising 8% over the previous year's figures.\n\nThis boost in sales is attributed to an enhanced offer environment for consumers. Dealers slashed prices in order to maintain their market share in this tough quarter and attract shoppers. Analysts believe that these efforts helped increase sales by a record-breaking 4.3% in December, setting a new all-time peak in retail spending.\n\nThe increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month to $349.4 billion - the highest figure recorded so far this year. Retail sales have surpassed the $4 trillion mark for the first time, and if automotive sales were excluded from the data, annual sales would break through the $5 trillion mark for the first time ever.\n\nDespite an unexpected rise in unemployment claims earlier this month, analysts are expecting improved jobs growth to feed through to the High Street with consumer spending remaining strong.
