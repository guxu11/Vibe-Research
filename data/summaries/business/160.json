{"raw_text": "GM pays $2bn to evade Fiat buyout\n \n General Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; \u00a31.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright.\n \n Fiat had sold GM a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement. But Fiat's heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away. The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures, but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. Fiat's shares on the Milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 GMT to 6.2 euros, having shot up more than 7% in early trading. \"We now have absolute freedom to design our own future,\" said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne.\n \n Analysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately, with another 550m to follow within 90 days. The firm is Italy's largest private employer, and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy. For its part, GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.\n \n \"We needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat,\" said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.\n \n The Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright. German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm, but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control. Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a \"put option\" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009. But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share. As a result, the sell-off looked better and better for the Italians - and much worse for GM, which is struggling with its own loss-making European marques Opel and Saab. The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving GM's stake to 10%.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "GM pays $2bn to avoid buying out Fiat; deal could have forced GM into a buyout of Italian carmaker Fiat; Fiat sold 6% stake for 20% of GM; deal allows Fiat to reduce debt and keep supplying diesel engines, while GM will unwind joint ventures.", "llama3.2:3b": "General Motors pays $2 billion to Fiat to exit a deal that could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright, as Fiat faces heavy losses.

Let me read through it first.\n\nThe main points seem to be about GM entering a deal with Fiat to avoid buying out its share. There are several events that happen over time: GM paying $2 billion to buy part of Fiat's stake, the consequences of this purchase including payoffs and financial changes for both companies, the performance of Fiat after the deal, and the implications for GM.\n\nSo, I should mention that GM is paying 1.55 billion euros to get out of the deal, which forces them to sell their stake in Fiat. The buyback isn't immediate but happens after some time passes. The pay-off means both companies will unwind their joint venture, but there will be costs for that. Fiat's stock rose a bit by 9 AM GMT.\n\nI should also note that GM is facing issues with their own European operations being in the red, which contributed to them paying out more. The company aims for $1 billion and then another $0.55 billion in the near term. This helps keep GM solvent. However, the financial performance of Fiat seems solid despite losing money.\n\nFiat's shares went up by 4.5%, but their success depends on their European business. If they don't reach the agreement, it could hurt the economy and workers. GM is focused on scaling in Europe to reduce costs, which worked smoothly with FIAT's strategy. However, FIAT didn't back down despite selling a portion of its finance arm.\n\nOverall, the summary should cover all these points without getting too detailed but still keeping all important elements.\n</think>\n\nGM will pay $1.55 billion euros (approximately $2 billion) to exit a deal with Fiat to avoid buying out its stake in 2004. The pay-off allows FIAT to sell part of the joint venture, reducing GM's debt and costs while benefiting FIAT by keeping it supplying diesel engines. FIAT shares on the Milan stock exchange rose 4.5% due to strong performance. GM aims for immediate payment of $1 billion with another $0.55 billion in the following nine months.
