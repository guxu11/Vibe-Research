In the fourth quarter, the city state's gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual rate of 2.4%. That was up from the third quarter, when it fell 3.0%, but was well below analyst forecasts. \"I am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number. The main drag came from electronics,\" said Lian Chia Liang, economist at JP Morgan Chase. Singapore's economy had contracted over the summer, weighed down by soaring oil prices. The economy's poor performance in the July to September period followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as Singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly Sars virus in 2003.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Singapore's economy grew 8.1% in 2004 and 2.4% in the fourth quarter, with a slowdown expected in 2005 due to global technology demand falls and US-China slowdowns.", "llama3.2:3b": "Singapore's economy grew 8.1% in 2004, led by a 13.1% manufacturing sector gain.

In Q4, GDP rose at a 2.4% annual rate, improving slightly from -3.0% in Q3 but below forecasts. Analysts attribute the weak performance mainly to electronics exports.

Let me start by reading through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence mentions Singapore's economy growing at 8.1% in 2004, which was the best performance since 2000 according to the trade ministry. That's a big deal because economic growth is often looked at in terms of indices like the GDP Deflator or PPIs.\n\nNext, it talks about the growth being led by manufacturing, with the key sector growing 13.1%. That makes sense as Singapore has strong tech sectors. However, a slower-than-expected fourth quarter suggests that the economy might face challenges in 2005 due to global tech demand falling back and other factors like the US and China's slowdowns.\n\nEconomic growth is set to be halved this year, going between 3% and 5%, with a Q4 GDP rise of 2.4%. The drop from the third quarter (which was -3%) is notable but not bad. The summer contraction is partly due to high oil prices. Also, in July to September, the economy had four quarters of double-digit growth after the Sars event, which helped it recover.\n\nLian Chia Liang at JP Morgan points out that the weak Q4 number was surprising because of other factors. He attributes part of the issue to electronics sales. Singapore's summer contraction and post-SEARS impact are important for understanding its economic performance.\n\nPutting this all together, I need a summary that highlights key points: 8.1% growth in 2004, leading by manufacturing, potential slowdowns due to tech demand and other factors, planned halving of growth this year, Q4 GDP up 2.4%, summer contraction due to oil prices, and the Sars impact on the economy.\n</think>\n\nSingapore's economy grew at an 8.1% rate in 2004, marking its best performance since 2000 as reported by the trade ministry. The growth was driven by manufacturing sectors with key growth at 13.1%. However, the fourth quarter saw slower-than-expected results, signaling potential slowdowns for 2005. Analysts expect economic growth to halve this year between 3% and 5%, with Q4 GDP rising 2.4% compared to the third quarter. The summer contraction was partly due to rising oil prices. Additionally, the global tech sector's recovery and the Sars virus impact from 2003 contributed to the economy's performance.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "Singapore's economic performance was solid in 2004, with GDP growing by an annual rate of 8.1%. The manufacturing sector contributed the most to growth, driven by a 13.1% rise in production, which was boosted by the strong dollar and weaker oil prices. However, a slower fourth quarter also weighed on overall performance, with the trade-driven economy expected to slow down for 2005 as global demand falls back due to technology uncertainties and the impact of the March 11 earthquake in Japan. The city-state's GDP is set to fall short of analyst expectations this year, with an annual rate of just 3% or 4%, compared to forecasts of around 5%.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " Singapore GDP grew by a strong 8.1% in 2004, making it the best performance since 2000. Key sectors contributing to this growth included manufacturing, which saw a 13.1% advance in the fourth quarter. The overall slowdown, however, could be attributed to global technology demand falling back. Major industries like electronics and services saw slower growth rates due to the Tsunami disasters that affected China and the US. Despite these setbacks, economists estimate Singapore's GDP may have contracted by as much as 2% in 2005.", "phi:2.7b": " In 2004, Singapore's economy grew by 8.1% and was its best performance since 2000. However, a slower fourth quarter due to global technology demand fall-back may cause more modest growth for the country in 2005, as well as a halved growth rate from 3%-5%.

In Q4 of 2004, GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.4%, up from 3.0% in the third quarter but still underestimating expectations.
