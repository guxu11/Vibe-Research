Let me read through it carefully first.\n\nThe text says that Saudi investors bought the Savoy hotel from Quinlan Private for \u00a3750 million last year. That's interesting because it shows that private equity firms can take such luxury properties, which are known to appreciate quickly due to their status.\n\nNow, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a prominent Saudi investor and CEO of HBOS bank, is the one who bought the Savoy. He has investments in some of the hotel's properties, like the George V in Paris. That makes sense because high-end luxury properties often attract big investors looking for a catch.\n\nThe seller is Quinlan Private, an Irish-based property firm, which makes sense since Prince is based there. They bought the Savoy, Simpson's, and another property before. The financial details of this deal weren't disclosed yet, so the exact numbers are probably not provided right now.\n\nSpeaking of financials, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts has a plan to renovate parts of the Savoy. Specifically, they'll invest $48 million in renovations like the River Room and suites with views over the Thames. They expect this work to be done by summer 2006. That's pretty soon for such renovations, which is good because hotels usually need updates to stay modern and attract guests.\n\nAlso, Fairmont mentioned that they'll manage Simpson's in the Strand restaurant. Simpson's is a well-known chain of fine dining restaurants nearby. This shows how these companies might work together on managing each other's properties, especially since they're close geographically.\n\nI should make sure I capture all the key points: Saudi investors buying the Savoy from Quinlan, Prince Alwaleed having some high-end hotel investments, Fairmont managing both the Savoy and Simpson's, and their financial plan for renovations. I need to keep it concise without any explanations or formatting.\n</think>\n\nPrince Alwaleed bin Talal, a prominent Saudi investor, purchased the Savoy hotel from Irish-based property firm Quinlan Private in \u00a3750 million last year.
