Let me read through it carefully.\n\nOkay, first paragraph: \"Worldcom boss 'left books alone'.\" That's interesting. So, they called him a \"left books alone,\" which probably means they thought he was going after financial fraud. Then there's some witness saying he never made accounting decisions and that he ordered false accounting by Scott Sullivan, who has admitted to fraud.\n\nNext, defense lawyers are trying to paint him as an affable boss, but they might be wrong because he was actually the one doing the accounting stuff. They're looking for someone else to blame for Worldcom's collapse because of competition too much and the boom petering out. \n\nFinally, Ebbers' trial is expected to take two months, and if he's found guilty, he'll face a big jail sentence. He hasn't committed anything himself, so they think him innocent.\n\nI need to make sure I capture the main points: his supposed innocence, the fraud accusations, false accounting by someone else, the company's collapse due to competition, and the trial plan.\n</think>\n\nWorldcom boss Bernie Ebbers was accused of overseeing $11 billion in fraud.
