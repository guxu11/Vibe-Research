{"raw_text": "Bad weather hits Nestle sales\n \n A combination of bad weather, rising raw material costs and the sluggish European economy has hit sales at Swiss food and drink giant Nestle.\n \n Revenue dipped 1.4% to 86.7bn Swiss francs ($74.6bn; \u00a339.1bn) in 2004 as sales of ice cream and mineral water were dampened by the wet summer.

Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.\n \n Nestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales. A poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - \"severely affected\" demand for ice cream.
