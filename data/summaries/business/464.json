Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says that eBay shares fell 9.8% on Wednesday after profits didn't meet expectations. They made $205.4 million in October-December compared to the previous year's $142 million, so they're ahead of what investors were expecting, but still not exactly where they should be.\n\nThen there's more about their revenue growth. Excluding special items, their profit was 33 cents a share, which is just under the 34 cents analysts expected. So close, but still below expectations.\n\nEbay also had an impressive payment service profit of $935 million compared to last year's $648 million, growing by 40%\u2014which is a solid growth number.\n\nMeg Whitman, eBay's CEO and president, highlighted the success of 2004 as momentum for 2005.
