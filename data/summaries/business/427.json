It may also intensify pressure on China to relax the peg joining its currency, particularly the yuan, as the weakening dollar. Despite this, government treasuries continue to attract investors in an increasingly tight financial environment.\n\nAccording to the ministry of commerce, China's total exports reach $63bn in December, up from $593.4bn in 2003. This is a continued 35.4% growth rate for the second year in a row. The country's tax chief noted that the growth trend has topped around 9% for two years in a row.\n\nIn the administration of taxation, a tightening of controls on tax evasion and the rapid expansion demonstrate increased tax revenues to $2.572 trillion yuan (\u20ac311bn; \u00a3165bn). Meanwhile, the state government's head Xie Xuren confirmed this high figure, making it an indicator of strong financial control.\n\nThe increased exports also coincides with a rise in trade deficit with $43.4bn, which was down from $310.9bn last year. This gap is further amplified by the steady increase in imports, which results in a negative profit margin.\n\nWhile these figures are significant, it's important to note that these conclusions are based on the perspective of an individual investor rather than a global financial market.

They specified that I should preserve key ideas and details but output only the summary as plain text without any explanations or formatting. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the entire text carefully to extract all important points. The main idea is that China's exports grew by 25% in 2004, which was a significant rise compared to the previous year. This growth was driven by their economic expansion and continued strong performance.\n\nI notice that the text mentions the trade surplus reaching six years, which is a sore point for some trading partners. It also suggests that this might increase pressure on China to adjust its currency peg with the dollar, possibly slowing down or tightening it further. \n\nThere are some specifics about tax revenues: the government confirmed a 25.7% growth in tax revenues from $2.398 trillion to $5.694 trillion. This is interesting because it includes both the growth and the rebates provided by exporters, which helped offset the losses.\n\nThe trade deficit situation with the U.S. has increased significantly, especially since the US had a much weaker dollar back then. The report mentioned that 1.5 million posts disappeared from labor-intensive industries to hi-tech sectors, showing faster economic expansion in tech areas after 2003. \n\nI should make sure to include all these details without making it too lengthy. I'll start by stating the export growth, mention the trade surplus's rise, touch on the tax revenues and rebates, and then detail the trade deficit with the U.S., including specific numbers from previous years.\n\nI need to ensure that my summary is concise but covers all key points.
