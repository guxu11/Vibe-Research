{"raw_text": "Euro firms miss out on optimism\n \n More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\n \n Their biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\n \n Global business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\n \n Already, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\n \n According to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n \n \n  - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects according to a survey of 1,300 bosses.

Regulatory stress in Western Europe and the UK, followed by slow growth, have led to confidence after years. Business analysts argue for a multi-pronged regulatory framework that allows companies to be much more transparent, but does not come without cost. Concerns around low-cost competition have slowed down significantly due to increased financial strain. Companies moving to outsource work to cheaper countries can cause harm if they do not adjust.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first part says that more than 90% of large companies are optimistic about their economic prospects. That's a key point because it sets the stage for the rest. The largest worries are over-regulation, low-cost competition, and wild price movements from oil. But there's an exception in Western Europe, except for the UK.\n\nNext, the text talks about PwC survey results two years ago showing that around 30% of bosses were gloomy. That gives a historical context. Now, they're talking about global leaders facing two-pronged regulation: transparency and accounting standards moving to IFRS. Hacking through these processes isn't easy for companies.\n\nAnother point is that some CEOs have moved operations into low-cost countries, which was previously less common but now seems more relevant. This has led to concerns about low-cost competition affecting their reputation and service quality. Samuel DiPiazza mentions that a growing number of companies worry that outsourcing might hurt home markets and harm customer service.\n\nThe survey shows that the US dollar's decline isn't as big of an issue anymore, unlike before when it was third-largest. This is surprising given current economic times. PwC executives are adjusting to the new exchange rates, which are stronger compared to before.\n\nPutting this together, I need to condense all these points into a concise summary. Focus on the main trends: high optimism globally except for Western Europe; concerns about regulation, low-cost competition, and outsourcing; historical PwC survey data showing some gloom but not as bad as it used to be; new exchange rate impact on companies' performance.\n\nI need to ensure I include all these points without adding extra details. So the summary should mention the high optimism, the specific concerns, the global regulatory changes, the shift in US dollar's role, and the impact of outsourcing.\n\nLet me structure this: Start with the main point about high optimism, then the concerns, include the exception, then discuss the regulation aspects from PwC, the US dollar change, and finally the outsourcing implications. Keep it clear and concise.\n</think>\n\nThe survey indicates that more than 90% of large companies worldwide are optimistic about their economic prospects, with a notable exception in Western Europe, except for the UK. Concerns include over-regulation, low-cost competition, and wild price movements from oil prices. In contrast to historical data showing around 30% gloom, PwC's recent findings highlight ongoing regulation, especially transparency through Sarbanes-Oxley and accounting standards IFRS. The US dollar decline is less impactful now, unlike before, with a stronger euro (1.30 EUR/USD). Companies are adjusting to new rates, particularly outsourcing to cheaper countries, which affects their reputation and service quality.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "According to a recent survey by global accounting firm PwC, large companies globally are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, with almost 90% of firms reporting an increase in revenue or profits over the past year. The largest worries for these firms? Not terror threats or low-cost competition, but rather regulatory changes and wild ups and downs in oil prices. Global business leaders say they're facing two such challenges: a tough regulatory assault from the US on corporate governance and accounting, while low-wage competitors threaten their repuation in home markets, leading to moves to outsource work to countries with cheaper labor costs. However, amidst the global economic slump, interviews with CEOs suggest a more positive attitude towards euro firms in Western Europe, though concerns about a potential euro-dollar exchange rate collapse linger.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " In the European business landscape, optimism is significantly lower than in North America. This might be due to a combination of factors including low-cost competition, regulatory pressure from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and concerns over the impact of currency fluctuations on global operations.
