{"raw_text": "Germany calls for EU reform\n \n German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits.\n \n Mr Schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3% limit if they met certain criteria. Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. Changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in March.\n \n The current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country's deficit to 3% of GDP. Countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the European Commission, although several countries, including Germany, have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. The European Commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules.\n \n Mr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. \"The stability pact will work better if intervention by European institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions,\" he wrote. \"Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU.\"\n \n Deficits should be allowed to rise above 3%, Mr Schroeder argued, if countries meet several \"mandatory criteria\". These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering \"special economic burdens\". The proposed changes would make it harder for the European Commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact's rules. Mr Schroeder's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact. The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members. Mr Schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact.

He noted that existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries running over the current limit without causing heavy fines.\n\nThe European Commission, however, acknowledged that it would not impose sanctions on states for breaching the agreement. Additionally, Mr Schroeder said several member countries have continued to fail to conform to the new rules even after a series of amendments.\n\nMr Schroeder argued that the proposed changes aim to make enforcement of these rules more difficult by limiting the size of an eurozone country's deficit above 3%.\n\nThe European Union has been striving to reform its stability agreement, while ensuring its integrity and fairness. As the eurozone powers have been established, Mr Schroeder is calling for the attention of the EU head of government to explore changes in how the agreement is governed.\n\nHe said that only under very specific conditions could the member states be willing to adjust their policies more coherently with the economic goals of the EU, as opposed to the broader European Community.\n\nFinally, Mr Schroeder added that while there is a growing concern about the impact of financial reform initiatives on European institutions, a meeting of all 25 EU members would likely lead to further clarification or even a resolution suggesting only limited changes are made.

Mr Schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened: In a separate statement, Mr Schroeder also said that existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3% limit if they met certain criteria.\n3. Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms: The German Chancellor has called for more flexibility in the EU's stability pact and wants heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact.\n4. Changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit: The current EU rules limiting the size of a eurozone country's budget deficit to 3% of GDP will need to be revised if they are not changed. This is expected to happen at an economic summit in March, where heads of government from all 25 EU member states will meet to discuss the pact.\n5.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nSo, Germany is pushing for radical changes in the EU's stability pact. The main points are that countries can run budget deficits above 3% if they meet certain criteria, like having costly reforms or economic issues. They wrote something in the Financial Times, so I should check that info too. From what I remember, several countries have breached these rules without facing sanctions.\n\nMr. Schroeder is a strong supporter of the pact and now sees it as needing more intervention from European institutions. He's advocating for changes because of costs involved in reform. For example, structural reforms or economic stagnation lead to higher deficits. He also mentioned \"special economic burdens,\" which I think refers to countries with significant deficits.\n\nThe reforms would make it harder for the EU Commission to challenge any country that breaks the rules. This would limit infringement actions and possibly reduce pressure on nations to improve their economic conditions too much, maybe even leading some towards reform but not as extreme.\n\nThere's a meeting planned between the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday and another in Tuesday's Ecofin meeting for all EU members. Mr. Schroeder wants heads of governments to have more say in these reforms. Some finance ministers might support limited changes only, which is concerning.\n\nOverall, the summary needs to cover Germany's push, existing rules about 3% deficits, mandatory criteria like costly reforms or economic issues, proposed reforms making it harder for the Commission to challenge countries, and the expected meetings with authorities.\n</think>\n\nGermany has called for radical reform in the EU's stability pact.
