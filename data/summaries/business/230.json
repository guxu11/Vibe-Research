Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main event is that Yukos dropped their banks from court bid because they were accused of involvement in selling Yugansk unit. They were bought by Rosneft for $9.3 billion, which the Russian state company paid to avoid a $27.5 billion tax bill. This legal action involved several big banks like ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Calyon, JP Morgan Chase, and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit has some interesting twists. There are references to Deutsche Bank as one of the consortiums behind a Gazprom bid for Yugansk. Gazprom was supposed to win but didn't bid, so they bought from Rosneft. Yukos's finances were moved to the US, and they're seeking bankruptcy and court injunction against the sale.\n\nThere's also mentions of Mikhail Khodorkovsky's motivations, including political ambitions, which might be why they faced legal action. Also, there are some nuances about who was involved in the purchase, like Razan Yagunov from Rosneft being part of a bid committee.\n\nThe US court is considering whether it can handle this case against Yukos. I need to make sure all these points are included in the summary without adding any extra information.\n</think>\n\nYukos dropped its assets from court bids due to allegations of involvement in the Yugansk unit's sale, which was bought by Rosneft for $9.3 billion.

However, the lawsuit also references Deutsche Bank as part of a consortium that might have bid for Yugansk, despite Gazprom not bidding.
