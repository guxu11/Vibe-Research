{"raw_text": "Nigeria to boost cocoa production\n \n The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\n \n Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; \u00a3591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\n \n Cocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\n \n At the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Nigeria plans to triple its cocoa production over three years through a development programme launched at Ibadan.

Let me read through it carefully first.\n\nThe main points are: Nigeria aims to triple cocoa production over three years with an ambitious development plan. Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello said they'll pump 154 million naira into subsidies for chemicals and seedlings. They currently produce around 600,000 tonnes of cocoa by 2008. Currently, Nigeria is the fourth-largest cocoa producer. Cocoa was main export during the 60s but fell from over 400k tonnes in '70 to about that same number later.\n\nThey plan to launch a program in Ibadan to encourage processing and lift local consumption. They already used 91 million naira for setting up cocoa nurseries. Some farmers are skeptical, especially those who don't farm. On Ghana's side, they broke new records with more than $1.2 billion exported in 2003-04 using advanced tech and spraying.\n\nSo the summary needs to capture these key points: goal of tripling production, funding from 154m naira, current 600k tonnes by 2008, cocoa being fourth-largest, cocoa's decline from '70, new initiative in Nigeria, planned use for nurseries, farmers' skepticism on '70s export, Ghana breaking records with advanced tech, and the contrast between Nigeria's cocoa production and Ghana's record.\n\nI should make sure to include all these elements but keep it concise. Maybe start with the government's aim, then the plan details like funding and new initiatives, agricultural performance before and after, and compare with other countries.\n</think>\n\nNigeria aims to triple cocoa production over three years with an ambitious development plan. Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello stated their initiative will pump 154 million naira for subsidies, aiming to increase production from 180,000 tonnes in '70 to 600,000 tonnes by '08. Nigeria is the fourth-largest cocoa producer currently, but cocoa declined from over 400,000 tonnes in '70. They plan to launch a program in Ibadan to encourage processing and lift local consumption.
