{"raw_text": "Hyundai to build new India plant\n \n South Korea's Hyundai Motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in India to meet the country's growing demand for cars.\n \n The company didn't give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year. This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. Hyundai expects its sales in India to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005. By 2010, it expects to nearly double sales to 400,000 cars. The new plant will be built close to the existing one in Chennai, in the southern province of Tamil Nadu.\n \n South Korea's top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010. Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. Figures show that currently only eight people per thousand are car owners. \"We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors,\" chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, Hyundai announced they'll build a second plant in India to meet the growing demand for cars there. They said the new plant will produce 150,000 cars annually, which is expected to boost their total production capacity by 67% to reach 400,000 units. That's one of the largest car manufacturers in South Korea.\n\nThe target sales are ambitious: they aim for 250,000 cars in 2005 and nearly double that to 400,000 in 2010. The plant will be built near Chennai in Tamil Nadu, which is south of the existing plant there. That makes sense because if it's next door, they might share some operations.\n\nThe growth estimates say India's market grows by 15% annually and reaches 1.6 million cars by 2010. But the market is due to poor public transport and low car ownership. Only eight people per thousand are car owners, so demand is high but in a vulnerable area.\n\nHyundai's chairman emphasized expanding production for their competitive edge, especially as they become one of the top five auto companies. They plan to export to Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and aim to be a global leader by 2010.\n\nI need to make sure I include all these key points: their target production numbers, growth projections, market conditions affecting demand, the location of the plant, and the vision for expanding globally.
