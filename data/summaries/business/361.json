Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says that consumer confidence is up at its highest for five months. That's a key point because it shows the economy is doing well. Then it mentions a survey indicating optimism about 2005, which suggests strong fundamentals.\n\nNext, there's some data on consumer sentiment. They say the feel-good factor rose in December since July, so people are feeling better about their lives and the economy. That makes sense because last month was a slow start to the holiday season.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Services Association (CFSA) did this survey with 5,000 households. The data shows renewed optimism on job creation and growth, which is good news for businesses. The strong sales in retail stores over the past ten days after a slow start makes sense because holiday shopping usually brings people back to work.\n\nThen it mentions that Wal-Mart's December sales are expected to be better than before because of post-Christmas rush. That probably means more consumers are spending during the holidays, so they're less stressed about the economic downturn at the end of the year.\n\nThe summary should include these points without getting into too much detail.
