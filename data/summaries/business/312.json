Let's see what they're asking for.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the provided text carefully. It seems like Parmalat is being sued by 45 banks over the collapse of an Italian dairy company. The firm was involved in a scandal that led them to go bankrupt with around 14 billion euros in debt. Enrico Bondi, their new boss, is taking legal action against several lenders and claiming the banks knew about the problems but continued working to keep the company afloat so they could earn commissions.\n\nFrom the text, it also mentions that Parmalat is trying to get back money before insolvency, under Italian law. They have already taken some actions. Now, they're planning further legal suits against 80 financial institutions, including banks like Bank of America, UBS, CVC, Deutsche Bank, and Citigroup, as well as auditors Grant Thornton.\n\nThey clarified that the firm was declared insolvent in December 2003 after some accounting issues were revealed. After that, they had a scandal where they increased billing to boost sales and maintain a strong balance sheet, which allowed them to borrow heavily and expand overseas, making them a big stock exchange player.\n\nThe user wants me to summarize this text into plain text only, without any explanations or formatting. They provided an example response earlier, so I can follow that structure.\n\nI should extract the key points: Parmalat's lawsuits against banks, the reasons (known problems but continued operations), legal actions from Enrico Bondi, the number of cases (45 so far?), and the specific institutions involved like the 35 in Italy and 10 others. Also, note that all these 80 institutions are financial institutions.\n\nI need to make sure I include all important details without getting too detailed. The example response did a good job listing each case, the countries involved, the list of companies, etc.\n\nSo my summary should have:\n- Number of lawsuits.\n- Reasons for the lawsuits (known problems but continued operations).\n- Names of the key banks and their identities.\n- Mention of the 35 in Italy, 10 others, total 45.\n- List of specific financial institutions.\n\nI think that covers everything.
