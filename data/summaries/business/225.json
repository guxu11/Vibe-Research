Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, compared with a year earlier. Consumers remain cautious over buying big-ticket items like furniture, said BRC director general Kevin Hawkins. Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector, the BRC said.

The user wants me to summarize it concisely, just key ideas and details. Hmm, let me read through the text again.\n\nThe first sentence says sales haven't helped recover from a bad Christmas season. That's important because December is often a peak month for shopping. Then it mentions that stores got boosts from bargain hunters but then went back to December levels. So, they made deals but didn't see the same sales as last year or even in previous years.\n\nNext, the BRC director general Kevin Hawkins points out that consumer confidence remains cautious, especially with furniture and big-ticket items like clothing and footwear. Higher interest rates and housing uncertainty are affecting the sector. But he also notes that clothing and footwear sales were better than December's average. Department stores also had good months despite some promotions.\n\nThe text also says there was no growth in unlike-for-like sales compared to the three months before Christmas, which makes sense because unlike sales tend to be lower. It mentions a previous survey showing Christmas 2004 was worse for retailers than any time since 1981, and office data shows December sales are worse again.\n\nI need to capture all these points in a concise summary without adding anything else. Let me make sure I include key ideas: sales haven't helped recover, increased sales due to bargain hunters but returned to previous levels, concerns about big-ticket items and consumer confidence, impact from interest rates and housing market uncertainty, better performance in specific categories like clothing, and the December sales being worse than expected.\n\nI should structure it so that each main point is a sentence or two. Maybe start with the overall impact of December on recovery, then mention the boost from bargain hunters vs. returning to previous levels, consumer concerns about big-ticket items, interest rates and housing uncertainty affecting the sector, better performance in specific areas like clothing, and finally the December sales being worse than expected.\n\nI need to ensure it's clear but not too wordy. Also, make sure all key details are included without adding any extra information. Okay, I think that covers everything. Let me put it together.\n</think>\n\nSales have not helped recover from a poor Christmas season in the UK, as January sales fell short despite boosted bargain hunting by stores. This led trading back to December levels, with similar or lower growth compared to previous years. Consumers remain cautious about buying big-ticket items like furniture, and higher interest rates along with uncertainty over the housing market continue to impact the retail sector. However, clothing and footwear sales were generally better than December, while department stores also performed well. The three-month period saw no growth in unlike-for-like sales compared to December, despite an increase in similar-for-like sales of -0.1%.

Despite positive signs of recovery in January, trading was generally better in the three-month period from December 2014 to January 2015, with department stores performing particularly well. The BRC cited \"dissatisfaction\" among consumers who were not willing to spend big-ticket items like furniture despite the lower interest rates and uncertainty over housing markets.
