Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing.

In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000. The better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. \"It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year,\" said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons.\n \n Other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week. \"It should empower the Fed to clearly do something,\" said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston. Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and neighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and September. The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the US's record trade deficit.

The user wants only the summary without explanations or any extra formatting or reasoning. Let me read through it first.\n\nThe text starts by saying the US added 337,000 jobs in October, which is a record high, far more than expected. It mentions that in a welcome boost for George W. Bush's re-election, they had some slow summer jobs gains, so now it's up.\n\nThen, the unemployment rate went up to 5.5%, but because more people were seeking work actively. So there are two factors: increased job creation and higher unemployment. The labor department revised their numbers a bit, saying less in the previous months than expected\u2014139k in Sep instead of 96k, and 198k in Aug instead of 128k.\n\nThis data affected stocks in New York, with the Dow Jones up by 45.4 points to 10,360. A economist named Gary Thayer says it's improving, supporting consumer spending during holidays and offsetting oil prices.\n\nOther experts mention that job growth makes the Fed more likely to increase interest rates by a quarter point to 2%. Some analysts think the dollar might rise temporarily due to job news but then fall back because other factors like trade deficit are causing it. There's also speculation about Bush trying to keep the dollar low for increased exports.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all these key points without getting too detailed. The summary should be concise, focusing on the key statistics and main conclusions.\n</think>\n\nThe US added 337,000 jobs in October, a record high, far exceeding Wall Street expectations. Unemployment rose to 5.5% from 5.4%, partly due to increased job creation. Job data showed double the previous month's estimates and higher than forecasts for September. This boosted stocks in New York, with the Dow Jones gaining 45.4 points to 10,360. A economist noted improvement supporting holiday consumer spending and offsetting oil prices. Analysts noted potential Fed rate increases due to job growth and speculation about the dollar's rise/fall influenced by trade deficit concerns.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "Leading economic indicators in US add more jobs than expected, indicating strong hiring activity and job creation, with every sector of economy recording new hires for the month of October.

However, stock markets initially rose following the release of better-than-expected jobs data, with the Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 at the beginning of New York trading hours. Other analysts stated that such upbeat data was likely to inspire higher interest rates from the US Federal Reserve when they meet next week. The dollar fell temporarily against the euro after being temporarily lifted by hopes of stimulus measures being introduced in response to weak job creation figures, but returned to a new record low against the euro as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the US's trade deficit.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " The United States government added more jobs than expected in October, according to data from the Labor Department. The revised estimate shows job creation increased by 337,000 to a seasonally adjusted total of 3,510,000. The previous estimate, released on September 24, forecasted fewer than 1,000,000 new jobs.\n\nThe October increase in job growth is significant for the US economy, which has been slow to recover from a slow summer of weak employment gains. Preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor showed that construction sector jobs increased by over 71,000, marking a seven-month high and well above Wall Street expectations. The increase in September was driven by hurricane-related cleanup work in Florida.\n\nThe Labor Department's data also reveals that the unemployment rate increased to 5.5% from 5.4% in September, but this was primarily due to an increase in the number of people actively seeking work. The separate unemployment rate rose to 5.7%, indicating a slight uptick in jobless rates across various sectors of the economy.\n\nThe October jobs report comes as the US stock market experienced a significant upward spike following the release of the revised data, with the Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading in New York. This improvement in job creation could have an immediate positive impact on consumer spending, as higher employment levels can lead to increased demand for goods and services.\n\nAnalysts are projecting that the US Federal Reserve will increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting, which is expected to be held next week in Washington D.C. If this decision is made, it could bolster the US economy by stimulating borrowing and investment. However, this could also lead to further price inflation for consumers, who will face higher costs for goods and services.\n\nIn summary, the October jobs report by the Labor Department reveals that the US economy added 3,510,000 new jobs in October, exceeding Wall Street expectations and providing a welcome boost to both newly re-elected President George W. Bush and American workers. The revised job creation data supports the idea that the US economy is improving and could support consumer spending during the holiday season.
