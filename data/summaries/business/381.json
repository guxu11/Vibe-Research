The original text is pretty dense with economic data and quotes from analysts.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the entire paragraph carefully to grasp the main points. It seems to be about oil prices in different regions affected by weather conditions. There's mention of New York weather affecting prices there, and then how that affects other areas like Asia and London.\n\nI notice the user wants only a summary without explanations or formatting. So, I should focus on capturing the key elements: the impact of cold weather on prices in the US, rebounding in Asia, issues with Brent crude in London, analysts' expectations, and the overall price trends compared to previous years.\n\nI'll make sure to include both good and bad points from each region. For example, the US prices fell due to mild weather but rebounded in Asia. The London market faced a suspension on public holidays, which caused the drop. Also, the impact of the Saudi oil crisis was mentioned as an external factor affecting the prices.\n\nI should keep it concise, ensuring all important data is included: the price reductions and increases, the seasonality in temperatures, and the overall economic implications. I need to avoid any extra details unless they're key to understanding the summary.\n\nFinally, I'll structure this into a clear, straightforward summary that adheres strictly to the user's instructions, avoiding any markdown or explanations.\n</think>\n\nThe global oil market experienced fluctuations due to weather-related price changes across regions.
