{"raw_text": "Wal-Mart fights back at accusers\n \n Two big US names have launched advertising campaigns to \"set the record straight\" about their products and corporate behaviour.\n \n The world's biggest retailer Wal-Mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers. The group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals, benefits package and promotion strategy. Meanwhile, drugs group Eli Lilly is planning a campaign against \"false\" claims about its product Prozac. Wal-Mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, using an open letter from company president Lee Scott saying it was time for the public to hear the \"unfiltered truth\".\n \n \"There are lots of 'urban legends' going around these days about Wal-Mart, but facts are facts. Wal-Mart is good for consumers, good for communities and good for the US economy,\" Mr Scott said in a separate statement.\n \n Its adverts - and a new website - outlined the group's plans to create more than 10,000 US jobs in 2005. Wal-Mart's average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $5.15 (\u00a33.90) an hour, while employees are offered health and life insurance, company stock and a retirement plan, the adverts say. Unions accuse Wal-Mart of paying staff less than its rivals do, with fewer benefits. In California, the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. Lawmakers in the state are also examining allegations that the firm burdens the state with an unfair proportion of employee health care costs. \"I think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people,\" said Larry Bevington, chairman of Save Our Community - a group fighting to prevent Wal-Mart opening a store in Rosemead, California. Wal-Mart is also fighting two lawsuits - one accusing it of discriminating against women and another alleging it discriminates against black employees.\n \n Meanwhile Eli Lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers, to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug Prozac.\n \n The move is in response to a British Medical Journal article that claimed \"missing\" Lilly documents linked Prozac to suicide and violent behaviour. In the averts, entitled An Open Letter from chief executive Sidney Taurel, the company says the article continues to \"needlessly spread fear among patients who take Prozac\". \"It was simply wrong to suggest that information on Prozac was missing, or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators,\" the letter added. Eli Lilly's chief medical officer Alan Breier said that the article was \"false and misleading\" as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and presented to an FDA meeting in 1991.

The user has given a detailed excerpt with several key points: Wal-Mart's advertising efforts aimed at addressing criticism over pay deals, benefits, and promotion strategy; Eli Lilly is promoting Prozac as the true medication despite some controversial claims; both companies have opposing ads to counter each other.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the main ideas. Wal-Mart is launching big advertisements in newspapers to correct their corporate practices, which they think others are criticizing. They're also aiming for a big job increase by 2005 and better benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. There's opposition from unions that feel they're being paid less than competitors.\n\nOn the other side, Eli Lilly is trying to get people to believe Prozac isn't dangerous or harmful. Their ads are meant to counter claims that they're missing important data linked to suicide or violence. The FDA said the documents were fake because they came from the FDA in 1991, and the FDA later agreed that the data wasn't up-to-date.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all these points concisely without adding any extra details. So, the summary should include Wal-Mart's advertising to correct corporate practices, their job increase plan, health benefits they're offering, unions' concerns about pay, Eli Lilly's opposing ads on Prozac, their claim documents being fake, and FDA stance.\n\nI should also note that both companies are fighting against each other in these campaigns. Maybe mention the specific locations where stores are opening? But the user didn't specify, so perhaps it's enough to refer to Rosemead for Save Our Community and other states.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll start with Wal-Mart, their ads, job increase, benefits, union concerns. Then move to Eli Lilly, their ads against Prozac, FDA claims being fake, and the FDA's response. Finally, mention both companies opposing each other.\n\nI should ensure that each summary is accurate and captures the key points without unnecessary details. Also, make sure there are no explanations or additional info, just plain text as requested.\n</think>\n\nWal-Mart has launched large advertising campaigns to correct its corporate practices, aiming to counter criticism from others over issues like pay deals, benefits, and promotion strategies. These ads, including an open letter from company president Lee Scott, highlight the good aspects of Wal-Mart's business model for consumers, communities, and the economy\u2014more jobs created in 2005 and various benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans. Unions are concerned about lower pay compared to competitors.  \n\nMeanwhile, Eli Lilly is promoting Prozac, the official anti-depressant drug, in ads aimed at addressing claims linking it to missing medical research and potential negative effects. Their claims, based on fake documents from the FDA, suggest Prozac is ineffective or unsafe.
