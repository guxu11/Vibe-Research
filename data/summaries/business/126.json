{"raw_text": "Barclays profits hit record level\n \n Barclays, the UK's third-biggest bank, has seen annual pre-tax profits climb to record levels boosted by a sharp rise in business at its investment arm.\n \n Profits for the year to 31 December rose 20% to \u00a34.6bn ($8.6bn). Barclays' chief John Varley said the bank had \"caught the winds\" of a very strong world economy.

Its Global Investors wing made \u00a3347m, an 82% jump on 2003 figures. Profits at Barclaycard rose by 5% to \u00a3801m but were said to have been affected by a series of interest rate rises and investment to grow its customer base.

Barclays cautioned that growth this year may be slower than in 2004 on the back of softer US and Chinese economies and the impact of interest rate rises on household spending in the UK. It added its bid to acquire a controlling stake in South Africa's leading retail bank Absa, was being considered by regulatory authorities. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Varley declined to be drawn on reports that Barclays had held merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo. A tie-up between Barclays and California-based Wells Fargo would create the world's fourth biggest bank, valued at $180bn.

Their investment wing made \u00a3347m, up 82% from before. Profits at Barclaycard went up 5%, but had interest rate rises and customer growth as issues.

Barclays's profit growth at its investment bank was up 25%, while retail business growth held back slower than before. The bank experienced interest rate rises affecting margins on its mortgage business and spending on branches. Analysts expect a 1% dip in the UK retail division, but they noted a \u00a31.13bn profit after a 20% increase from the previous year.
