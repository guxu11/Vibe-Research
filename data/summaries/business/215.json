{"raw_text": "SEC to rethink post-Enron rules\n \n The US stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.\n \n In a speech at the London School of Economics, William Donaldson promised \"several initiatives\". European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n \n The Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.\n \n Firms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements\". There are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the Act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.\n \n The 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Mr Donaldson said the SEC would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.\n \n \"We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections\" without turning the US market into \"one with no exit\", he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act's least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (\u00a3374m).\n \n A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.\n \n It was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UK's Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF, Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (\u00a3558m) stock market debut last month. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead, the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong, according to press reports in China.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering softening new corporate governance rules that were introduced after the Enron scandal to ease the burden on foreign firms.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe text starts by talking about the US stock market watchdog's chairman wanting to soften the new rules because foreign firms are facing higher costs. They made a speech at London School of Economics, where they promised several initiatives. European companies protested that the US laws make Wall Street listings too expensive for them.\n\nThen it mentions Sarbanes-Oxley Act. I know this one from the scandal, and it's supposed to help executives comply with internal controls by signing compliance statements in their annual accounts. critics say it makes firms more expensive because they have to declare things, which is a big expense. If that happens, foreign companies might get fines or jail time if they break the law.\n\nThe Act was introduced in mid-2005 and is now in effect. It's supposed to help with things like preventing corporate fraud by making declarations. The US regulator said they'd continue to focus on accommodating foreign structures and requirements. But there are few people against this act, which includes making executives sign those compliance statements.\n\nHowever, European companies with NYSE secondary listings have objected because the costs of compliance seem too high compared to the benefits. They're worried that not all firms will follow, especially small ones like Air China using the London Stock Exchange and Chinese banks sticking to Hong Kong instead of New York.\n\nThe text also talks about a 300 shareholder threshold. It says this has blocked the easiest fix, which is listing firms without US shares, leading some to delay implementing compliance clauses. The chairman is weighing delays for foreign companies, especially those like smaller firms with less than $700 million in market cap.\n\nThere were delays in speeding up the Act's implementation. For example, smaller firms like US-sized ones had their compliance issues delayed, and now they're being considered by the SEC. A delegation of European firms visited the SEC to push for changes, and companies like Air China used London, while others moved to Hong Kong or not list at all.\n\nOverall, the summary needs to capture the main points: softening regulations, the act's role in compliance costs, Europe's opposition due to high costs, the 300 shareholder threshold blocking easy solutions, and the delay in implementing some clauses.\n\nI need to make sure I include key details without getting too detailed. Maybe mention William Donaldson's speech, the act's purpose, European opposition, the threshold problem, and the delegation visit.\n</think>\n\nThe US stock market watchdog chairman is considering softening tough new corporate governance rules due to concerns about foreign firms' increased compliance costs.
