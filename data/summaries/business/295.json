December's confidence level was below that seen in September, the Bank of Japan said. However, September's reading was the strongest for 13 years. \"The economy is at a pause but unlikely to fall\", the economy minister said. \"It will feel a bit slower (next year) than this year, and growth may be a bit more gentle but the situation is that the recovery will continue,\" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka.

With the recovery slowing, the world's second biggest economy is now expected grow by 0.2% in 2004. The Tankan index is based on a survey of 10,227 firms. Big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of 2005; their views suggest the March reading could go as low as 15 - still in positive territory, but weaker. The dollar's decline has strengthened the yen, making Japanese exports more expensive in the US. China's attempts to cool down its fast-growing economy have also hit Japanese industry's sales abroad. Confidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of 2004, but it is forecast to drop one point in the March survey. Nonetheless, Japanese firms have been stepping up capital investment, and the survey found the pace is quickening.

Heizo Takenaka, the economy minister, emphasized the recovery will continue but is not expected to slow down significantly next year due to a moderate slowdown in the economy.\n\nThe Tankan index, based on surveys of 10,227 firms, shows Japanese companies' business conditions are better than those from September, with big manufacturers even more pessimistic.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that business confidence has dropped for the first time since March 2003. It's a big deal because it affects how Japan's economy is doing.\n\nThen, there are several reasons given: slower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen, and weaker exports. The Bank of Japan says these factors caused the drop in confidence. I should note that these economic pressures hit during December when their confidence level was below what it was in September.\n\nThe economists also made some predictions. They said the economy is at a pause but not going to fall next year, and growth will be slightly more gentle than this year. The previous survey showed an increase of 0.1% from September's data, but now they expect slower growth. That's interesting because it suggests Japan might have a slow recovery.\n\nJapan's own data shows their economy grew just 0.1% in the first three months. They mentioned that with the slowdown, the second-largest economy is expected to grow by 0.2% in 2004. The Tankan index based on 10,227 companies shows this. \n\nLooking at the manufacturing side: they were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of 2005. Their confidence readings could go as low as 15, but still in positive territory. The dollar's decline has boosted the yen, making imports more expensive for Japan. Chinese companies are also trying to cool down their economy, which is affecting Japanese industry sales.\n\nConfidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the last quarter of 2004, but they're expected to drop one point in the March survey. So, Japan's confidence is a bit higher now compared to before? Or does it mean something else?\n\nHowever, overall, they've been capitalizing on past gains by investing more, with an increase of 7.7% versus expectations' 6.1%. This suggests a quick recovery.\n\nPutting this all together, the summary should capture the main points: decline in business confidence, various economic factors, economists' projections about growth and recovery pace. I need to make sure each key point is included without getting too detailed.\n</think>\n\nJapan's business confidence dropped for the first time since March 2003, according to a revised survey.
