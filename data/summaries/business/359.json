Press reports have speculated that Fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim.

The agreement in question dates back to GM's decision to buy 20% of Fiat's auto division in 2000. At the time, it gave the Italian firm the right, via a 'put option', to sell the remaining stake to GM.

Fiat has clarified that it is legally obligated to buy 90% of its cars at a price less than or equal to the current owned ones, while GM agrees that such a sale does not violate any existing regulations.

Mr Marchionne is confident in his firm's legal position with the press conference report that GM argued that an Italian car sale wasn't binding or valid. The agreement dates back to GM\u2019s decision to buy 20% of Fiat\u2019s auto division from 2,000 last year. The agreement gives Italian banks the right to sell the remaining stake but requires them to make a 'put' option.\n\nFiat has been able to reiterate its claims that this 'put' is still valid and legally binding in recent weeks, which means that it has agreed on a new agreement that could lead to an automatic reversal of the sale. However, GM argues that if Fiat were willing to cancel the \u2018put\u2019 option, it might mean a direct return from the Italian car sale. In terms of political pressure, the two firms have argued since last year for a negotiation to be held.\n\nThe selling of the Fiat's car-making unit may not prove easy as it is closely tied with the industrial heritage of Italy.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main points are: FIAT is trying to buy GM's car division. They're arguing about how legal their claim is. FIAT wants to sell the auto unit, while GM wants to keep it because they can sell it now for a discount. The deal was signed in 2000, but the contract might be invalid because GM is buying a part of FIAT. FIAT says if GM doesn't buy the rest, they'll get cash. Both companies are trying to save money as demand wanes.\n\nThe meeting is happening in Zurich at 3 PM GMT, and it's about to start. I saw some other mentions like Marchionne being confident, but the main focus here is their financial arguments and the legal issues.\n\nI should include key details: FIAT's claim on GM's auto division, GM rejecting the contract because it's invalid due to the 'put option' from FIAT. FIAT may accept cash for dropping the claim. They want to sell the car division now to save costs but could back out if GM doesn't buy all of FIAT.\n\nI need to make sure I capture their differing opinions on the legal aspect and the potential financial impacts.\n</think>\n\nFIAT is attempting to acquire GM's car division, arguing that GM still holds a valid 'put option' under the 2000 contract. However, GM claims this option has ended due to FIAT selling its remaining stake for a discount, affecting their agreement with FIAT for $90 million in assets. FIAT may accept cash instead of buying all of FIAT's auto division if GM doesn't buy the remaining part, while GM wants to sell the car division now to reduce costs and save money.
