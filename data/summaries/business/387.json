{"raw_text": "Germany nears 1990 jobless level\n \n German unemployment rose for the 11th consecutive month in December - making the year's average jobless total the highest since reunification.\n \n The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose a higher than expected 17,000 to 4.483 million, the Bundesbank said. Allowing for changes in calculating statistics, the average number of people out of work was the highest since 1990 - or a rate of 10.8%. Bad weather and a sluggish economy were blamed for the rise. The increase \"was due primarily to the onstart of winter\", labour office chief Frank-Juergen Weise said.\n \n Unadjusted, the figures showed unemployment rose 206,900 to 4.64 million - with many sectors such as construction laying off workers amid bad weather. \"The three years of stagnation in the German economy came to an end in 2004. But the upturn is still not strong enough\" to boost the labour market, Mr Weise added. News of the rise came as government welfare reforms came into force, a move that is expected to see unemployment swell still further in coming months. Under the Hartz IV changes, the previous two tier system of benefits and support for the long term unemployed has been replaced with one flat-rate payout. In turn, that means more people will be classified as looking for work, driving official figures higher.\n \n \"Be prepared for a nasty figure for January 2005, about five million unemployed on a non-seasonally adjusted basis,\" warned HVB Group economist Andreas Rees. But he did add that the numbers should \"subside\" throughout the year, to remain near 2004's level of 4.4 million jobless. \"I don't expect a strong and lasting turnaround until 2006,\" German Economy minister Wolfgang Clement said. By 2010, however, the Hartz IV reforms should help cut the average jobless rate to between 3% and 5%, he added.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, Germany's unemployment rose for the 11th month in a row, making the year's average jobless total the highest since reunification. That's pretty significant because usually, when you have an 11th consecutive rise, it doesn't go as high as two years ago. So I should note that the figures went from maybe around 4.5 million to over 4.64 million.\n\nThen there was a seasonally adjusted figure where the total rose by a higher than expected 17,000, bringing it up to 4.483 million. This means people were out of work more often since the previous year. The bad weather and a sluggish economy are mentioned as possible reasons. Frank-Juergen Weise from the German Labour Office said the rise was mostly due to winter arriving.\n\nUnadjusted figures show an even higher increase: 206,900 to 4.64 million. Many sectors like construction were laying off workers during bad weather, which is a problem because they might not be able to find work quickly.\n\nThere's also a mention of the economy turning from stagnation into a recovery. It says the three years had come to an end in 2004, but the upturn isn't strong enough to boost the labor market. So even though some areas are recovering, others like construction and services might still struggle. The government is implementing welfare reforms through Hartz IV changes, which are flat-rate payouts instead of the previous tier system. This should affect more people, increasing unemployment officially.\n\nA economist from HBV Group warned that January 2005 could see about five million unemployed on a non-seasonally adjusted basis. But over time, the numbers should decrease to near 4.4 million as before. He also said he's not expecting a big turnaround until at least 2006. The economy minister said by 2010, Hartz IV reforms might cut unemployment between 3% and 5%.\n\nNow, putting it all together into a concise summary. I'll include the key points: high unemployment rise, seasonally adjusted figures, bad weather and economy issues, government reforms, and expected trends in January and beyond.\n\nI need to make sure not to explain anything, just present the main ideas from the text.\n</think>\n\nGermany saw significant unemployment growth in 2004-2005, rising for the 11th consecutive month and reaching an all-time high.
