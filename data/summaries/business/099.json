Meanwhile, Asian carmakers fared well - Toyota sales jumped 11% while rival Nissan notched up a 10% increase.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first paragraph mentions that GM and Ford were forced to cut output when sales dropped because fuel prices were high for big trucks and SUVs. They blamed fuel prices on low sales of those vehicles, which made them lose profits. Then, GM says their truck sales fell 9% and car business tumbled 17%. Some new products like the G6 and Cobalt did well.\n\nFord's part is also about sales dropping by 3%, but they're cutting production in North America even though sales are down.
