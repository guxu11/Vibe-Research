Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that Nissan has named Carlos Ghosn as a lifetime employee. That's important because Ghosn will take over as the chief operating officer of Nissan after Toshiyuki Shiga. I need to make sure both names are included in the summary.\n\nNext, the text explains Mr. Ghosn's role. He was the chief executive and has successfully led Nissan into a fast-paced environment, turning around its losses into profits. Key points here include his cost-cutting measures and workforce reductions, along with how these actions boosted the company's financial performance. Also, it talks about Nissan increasing its market share by launching new models.\n\nThen, there's a section on Mr. Shiga, whose role is to follow in Ghosn's footsteps but take more responsibility for global sales and marketing. He was also previously in charge of global operations across Asia and Australasia, which helped Nissan improve its sales in China.\n\nThe text mentions that Mr. Ghosn will allocate 40% of his time to each company (Nissan and Renault), along with the rest to North America and other markets. This highlights how he's balancing responsibilities between different business segments.\n\nMr. Ghosn also made some management appointments for younger executives, but that might be more detailed than needed for a concise summary focused on key ideas.\n\nPutting it all together, I should highlight Ghosn's role as the successor, his achievements in Nissan, and how Shiga will take over with increased responsibility for sales and marketing. Also, noting Ghosn's new management allocation is important to show how he's handling multiple responsibilities now.\n\nI need to make sure I capture both the leadership roles and the financial impact of Ghosn's changes on Nissan.
