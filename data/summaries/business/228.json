Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main event is that Sri Lanka banks are struggling after the December tsunami. They face hard times because a lot of people died and huge properties were lost. The association said some 13% of their loans were damaged or written off, which is significant. Also, state-owned lenders might be worse off since they have bigger debts.\n\nBanks are dealing with customers who die and those with damaged collateral, meaning most are trying to get loans because they're rebuilding. They\u2019re giving cheap loans for rebuilding and time to repay existing debts. This leads to a revenue issue in 2005, causing problems for the banks.\n\nAL Gooneratne told a news conference that many banks can\u2019t collect interest because they have MORatoriums or won\u2019t give it out in this quarter.
