{"raw_text": "Iraq and Afghanistan in WTO talks\n \n The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to hold membership talks with both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n \n But Iran's bid to join the trade body has been refused after the US blocked its application for the 21st time. The countries stand to reap huge benefits from membership of the group, whose purpose is to promote free trade. Joining, however, is a lengthy process. China's admission in 2001 took 15 years and talks with Russia and Saudi Arabia have been taking place for 10 years. Membership of the Geneva-based WTO helps guarantee a country's goods receives equal treatment in the markets of other member states - a policy which has seen it become closely associated with globalisation.\n \n Iraq's Trade Minister Mohammed Mustafa al-Jibouri welcomed the move, describing it as significant as November's decision by the Paris Club of creditor nations to write off 80% of the country's debts. Assad Omar, Afghanistan's envoy to the United Nations in Geneva, said accession would contribute to \"regional prosperity and global security\". There are now 27 countries seeking membership of the WTO. Prospective members need to enter into negotiations with potential trading countries and change domestic laws to bring them in line with WTO regulations. Before the process gets under way, all 148 WTO members must give their backing to applicant countries. The US said it could not approve Iran's application because it is currently reviewing relations.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, it mentions that the WTO is going to hold talks with both Iraq and Afghanistan. But then it says Iran's bid to join the trade body has been refused after the US blocked its 21st application for membership in 2023. That\u2019s a key point because it's about why Iran won't join now.\n\nNext, it talks about how joining the WTO would give them big benefits from free trade. So they can get better treatment in other countries' markets. But membership is a long process involving years of negotiations with various countries and changing laws. This might take a while compared to countries like China or Russia, which have already done it quickly.\n\nThe text also mentions that China joined the WTO back in 2001 after 15 years of delay, and so has Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, talks are ongoing between China and Russia for another round with 10 years left. That shows that some countries can do this faster than others.\n\nThen there's a quote from Iraq's Trade Minister saying the move is significant to November's decision by Paris where they closed off debt writes. It sounds like it's making them feel better about joining, especially in the context of global trade.\n\nAs for Afghanistan, their envoy to the UN in Geneva, Asad Assad, says admission would help regional prosperity and security. They have 27 countries looking to join now, which is a lot, so the process must be lengthy.\n\nEuropean Union ambassador to the WTO, Carlo Trojan, said that Iran's application should be treated separately from politics, but this might not hold water because some already applied in previous years. He\u2019s concerned about political issues here.\n\nI think I need to condense all these points into a concise summary without adding any extra info or explanations. Just focus on the main ideas: why Iran's join is denied, benefits for both Iraq and Afghanistan, the process being time-consuming, China's similar experience, the current state of global membership in the WTO.\n</think>\n\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is set to hold talks with both Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran's application for membership has been refused after the US blocked its 21st proposal. The WTO aims to promote free trade among member countries, so this move could benefit both nations significantly. However, joining requires long negotiation processes involving multiple countries and changing laws, which is time-consuming compared to other WTO members like China. Already, China and Saudi Arabia have joined the WTO in their respective years. 27 countries are seeking membership, with a lengthy process expected to follow.
