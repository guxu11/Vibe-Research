{"raw_text": "Boeing unveils new 777 aircraft\n \n US aircraft firm Boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer.\n \n The 777-200LR will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop, linking cities such as London and Sydney. Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.\n \n Analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.\n \n It is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing's twin-aisle 777 plane. The company offically \"rolled-out\" the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT. Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.\n \n \"Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,\" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. But the 777-200LR \"is a niche player\", Mr Learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.\n \n For Airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. It has been producing a rival to Boeing's 777 line for more than a year. \"Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago\" with its product range, said Flight International's Mr Learmount.\n \n Both Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years. It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan. These orders should help underpin the company's profits. Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract. Net profit was $186m (\u00a398m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Boeing unveils new long-distance 777 aircraft, aiming to regain its position as industry leader.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main points are: Boeing has launched a new 777-200LR plane which can fly up to 11,000 miles, connecting London and Sydney. It's faster than European airlines like Airbus, who have the 787 Dreamliner. Analysts say this is a big deal for the industry.\n\nBoeing is focusing on smaller planes with twin engines, aiming to connect anywhere in the world quickly. They also mentioned GE engines are better and lighter materials. Orders from Pakistan and EVA Taiwan showed they're taking demand.\n\nAirbus is competing too but with their 787 Dreamliner, which can carry more passengers. Their product line hasn't changed much since last year. They're working on costs as well, cutting production of the smallest planes.\n\nThe text covers both companies' approaches, highlighting Boeing's direct routes and Airbus's larger capacity. I should keep it concise, focusing on key ideas like the aircraft's capabilities, the approach each company is taking, and the industry implications.\n</think>\n\nBoeing has introduced its 777-200LR, a fuel-efficient twin-engine plane capable of flying over 11,000 miles between major cities. This competitor to European rival Airbus' 787 Dreamliner aims to connect anywhere quickly with improved fuel efficiency and lower weights. Analysts say the competition marks a pivotal moment for the airline industry.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Boeing's New Plane:** 777-200LR can fly up to 11,000 miles, linking London and Sydney. It reduces connecting flights.\n- **Directional Focus:** Boeing aims direct routes, focusing on fuel efficiency with GE engines and lighter materials.\n- **Order Numbers:** Orders from Pakistan and EVA Taiwan are in, contributing to profits.\n- **Airbus' Move:** Competes with their 787 Dreamliner for larger passenger capacities, though they're still focused on twin-engine planes.\n- **Cost Efficiency:** Busier by two seats per plane, aiming to reduce costs.\n- **Industry Implications:** Competition could define the future of commercial aviation.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "Boeing unveils new long-distance 777 aircraft and plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flight.

Boeing claims that this new aircraft is capable of flying over 11,000 miles non-stop between two cities. This innovative feature allows for greater efficiency and improved passenger comfort compared to previous models.\n\nThe 777-200LR's designers have been working to reduce fuel consumption and improve overall emissions while still maintaining its spacious cabin, range, and seating capacity. Boeing has also introduced a new type of engine, designed by General Electric (GE), which will provide improved fuel efficiency compared to previous models. The plane is being produced in Seattle at the company's main facility and is set to enter service by late 2008.\n\nThe introduction of the 777-200LR also marks a turning point for Boeing, as it moves away from its focus on short-haul routes and towards longer flights with more passengers. This shift in strategy has been driven by increasing competition in the airline industry, as well as changing market conditions and the need to stay ahead of Airbus's advances in the development of larger, fuel-efficient planes.\n\nDespite these challenges, Boeing remains confident that its new aircraft will succeed and continue to be a major player in the world of commercial aviation. With over 200 orders for the 777-200LR, it is expected to sell about 500 units during the next two decades, helping to underpin its profits.
