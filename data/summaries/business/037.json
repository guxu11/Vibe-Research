{"raw_text": "Japanese mogul arrested for fraud\n \n One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\n \n Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\n \n There was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount.

His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Japanese billionaire Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was arrested on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on false data.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, it mentions that he was ranked as the world's richest man and had a big business empire in Japan. He did things like run hotels, railways, construction, and even a baseball team. He ran the Winter Olympics in 1998, which is pretty famous. But now, last year, he faced some serious legal issues because of something called \"fraud.\" I think that means he lied about share-ownership structures or something.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The text says he was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels. So, he left to go somewhere else. The city is Tokyo, and those are the details given.\n\nNow, he's facing criminal charges because the Japanese stock market rules say that no company can be more than 80% owned by its top 10 shareholders. That means if a company has more than 20%, it needs at least one shareholder to own less than 80%. Seibu Railways was listed before, but now it's delisted from the stock exchange because he used false data.\n\nHis shares have gone down a lot too\u2014maybe even bought out by another company. He's been fired from all his business posts. His determination seems tied to something: when he dined with his father and got angry for letting him use a silk futon, which was a luxury item then.\n\nHe describes it as feeling enormous pressure at the time, scolding for not being overly nice or not giving children proper attention. Maybe that's how his parents had made him money\u2014buying properties after rebuilding Japan after WWII.\n\nThere are other companies in Japan with similar issues too, like Mitsubishi Motors and Japan's troubled UFJ bank. Twelve managers there were charged about covering up safety defects in their cars and concealing bad loans from the bank.\n\nSo, summarizing all that, Tsutsumi is being punished for making it look like he lied to others about his shares and business dealings. He used fraud-related stock options as a way to avoid paying taxes or cheat on stock buybacks. His arrest will likely lead to him serving time in prison.\n</think>\n\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was arrested globally for fraud, leading to legal consequences after being linked to false share ownership structures and conduct. After his arrest, Seibu Railways and part of Mitsubishi Motors were fined with penalties.
