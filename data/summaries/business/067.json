{"raw_text": "FAO warns on impact of subsidies\n \n Billions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism, the UN's Food & Agriculture Organisation has warned.\n \n Trade barriers and subsidies \"severely\" distort the market, the FAO report on the \"State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2004\" said. As a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.\n \n The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market. It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.\n \n According to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. In fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (\u00a3158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. These countries are mainly situated in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "The UN's Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has warned that billions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk due to falling commodity prices and protectionism.

The FAO urges swift action from the World Trade Organisation to liberalize trade and reduce tariffs, advocating for greater access for developing countries in global markets.  The report further acknowledges the impact of high tariffs on products like cotton and rice, with major exporting powers benefitting at the expense of developing nations.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence mentions that Billions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism. That gives me a clear point: farmers' incomes could drop if prices go up or trade restrictions hit them hard.\n\nNext, the FAO report talks about how subsidies and trade barriers \"severely\" distort the market. This distortion causes food insecurity, especially affecting those in least-developed countries because their livelihoods are more vulnerable.\n\nThe FAO also mentions that support for farmers in developed nations is way higher than what's provided for poor countries. They say farmers there get 30 times as much as aid to agriculture in developing areas. That makes the argument stronger that trade policies need changes.\n\nThen, it suggests World Trade Organisation (WTO) should negotiate with each other on liberalizing trade. High tariffs and subsidies hurt global exporters who rely heavily on these products from EU and US, which sell them cheaply. The FAO recommends that developing countries cut their own tariffs to make more of their agricultural exports available worldwide.\n\nAlso, the report points out that subsidies and high tariffs affect cotton and rice export heavily, with many wealthy nations buying a lot in agricultural subsidies. They separate developing countries into two groups: those with diverse products and those controlled by small farmers. These low-income countries are mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.\n\nI need to capture all these points concisely without getting too detailed. I'll mention the impact on farmers' livelihoods, the role of subsidies and trade barriers, the welfare of developing countries, and the recommendations from FAO and WTO.\n</think>\n\nThe FAO warns that subsidies and high tariffs severely distort agricultural markets, leading to food insecurity in developing countries. It recommends World Trade Organisation negotiations for liberalization and calls for developed countries to reduce tariffs to allow agricultural exports to global markets. The report highlights issues with cotton and rice production, with most globally sourced products from EU and US heavily reliant on farmers.
