{"raw_text": "Russian oil merger excludes Yukos\n \n The merger of Russian gas giant Gazprom and oil firm Rosneft is to go ahead, but will not include Yugansk, which was controversially bought last year.\n \n The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares. Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off. Under the agreement, the state will get a controlling share of Gazprom in exchange for Rosneft. The state wanted to control Gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade. Speaking on NTV television, which is controlled by Gazprom, Mr Miller added that Yugansk, which was swallowed up by Rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state-owned oil firm headed by current Rosneft chief Sergei Bogdanchikov. According to reports from Russian News Agency Interfax, the deal should go through in the next two to three months.\n \n \"Obtaining majority control over Gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in Gazprom shares,\" Mr Miller added. By opening up trading in Gazprom to foreigners, the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders. Currently, foreigners can only trade in Gazprom via a small issue of London-listed proxy shares. \"This is positive news for the international investment community,\" Global Asset Management investment chief David Smith said. \"The majority of investors are going to be happy,\" he added.\n \n However, analysts were disappointed that Yugansk would not be included in the deal. \"Yugansk is a heavy cashflow generator and would have been a much better asset for Gazprom,\" Renaissance Capital energy analyst Adam Landes told Reuters news agency. But he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom. \"Ultimately and industrially, Gazprom needs Yugansk,\" he added. Analysts said the deal would give Gazprom control of 8% of Russia's total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over Yugansk. However, the merged group will still remain outside Russia's top five oil producers - led by Lukoil with 11% of the market , followed by TNK-BP which is half owned by BP, and Surgutneftegaz. Instead, the merged Gazprom-Rosneft group will rank alongside Sibneft with 7% of the market. Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed auction in December, following what many thought was a politically-motivated attack on Yukos. The shell company was then snapped up by Rosneft. Yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the US courts. The unit was auctioned by Russian authorities to help pay off a $27.5bn back-tax bill.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Russian oil merger excludes Yugansk, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares, and will give Rosneft control of 8% of Russia's total oil production.", "llama3.2:3b": "Gazprom and Rosneft will merge, with Gazprom getting a controlling share and foreigners allowed to trade its shares.

First, I'll read through it carefully to understand the main points.\n\nThe text starts by mentioning that the merger excludes Yugansk, which was bought last year. So, they're merging two big companies but not including an older one. They want to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares. The state will get a controlling share of Gazprom for this, and instead of owning Yugansk, it'll spin it off as its own oil company. This seems like a strategic move for Gazprom.\n\nMr. Miller confirmed that Yugansk isn't part of the deal; Rosneft will take over, and the state gets control of Gazprom through a proxy. The report from Interfax says they plan this in two to three months. There's a mention of Gaussian expansion, making Gazprom a top emerging market for investors.\n\nDavid Smith from Global Asset Management is happy about this as it opens up more opportunities for trading globally. But analysts are upset because Yugansk isn't included. They're worried about the lack of control and potential issues with Yukos, which was sold by Rosneft after a financial drama. This move might dilute Gazprom's shareholdings but still position them outside Russia's top five producers.\n\nI need to condense this into a concise summary without any extra details or explanations. I'll focus on the key points: the merger excludes Yugansk, allows foreign investors access, changes ownership structure, and discusses market implications.\n</think>\n\nGazprom and Rosneft will merge, excluding Yugansk which was bought last year. The deal aims to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares, with the state controlling Gazprom while Rosneft owns Yugansk. This move is part of liberalizing the Russian oil market and prepares Gazprom for growth as a top emerging market.

The merge is expected to lead to the liberalisation of the market in Gazprom shares, though the company will remain outside Russia's top five oil producers.

Despite this, the merger is seen as a positive step towards opening up the Russian oil market to foreign investors.

You can choose to include or not include any of the companies.\n2) Each of the three countries - Russia, UK, and USA \u2013 has a rule: \n    - The UK will only support a merger if it results in at least 15% of Russian oil production being under foreign control (foreign company's share must be higher than 15%)\n    - The US has no specific rules about the merger.\n3) If the UK supports the merger, and the total shares held by Russian state are less than 25%, then the Russian state will have majority control over Gazprom.\n4) You need to consider all possible combinations of companies that can be included in the merger without breaking any rules. \n5) The final decision is based on which combination gives the Russian state the highest chance (50% or more) of having majority control over Gazprom, without violating the UK's rule.\n\nQuestion: Which companies should be considered for the merger to give Russia the maximum probability of achieving its objective?\n\n\nFirst, identify all possible combinations and then apply the rules to eliminate those that violate any of them.\nInclude Gazprom, Rosneft, and Yugansk (Yukos) in the merger. This will comply with both UK's rule and the Russian state having majority control over Gazprom due to majority shareholding by Rosneft. However, this combination gives Russia a total oil production under foreign control of about 16%, which is below the 15% requirement set by the UK.\nInclude only Gazprom and Rosneft in the merger. This will comply with both UK's rule (since only these two companies have any foreign ownership) and Russia has majority control over Gazprom, but this would leave Russia's total oil production under foreign control at 10%.\nConsider not including Yugansk in the merger. This is okay with both rules as it doesn't break UK's rule regarding 15% foreign control and does not affect Russia having majority control of Gazprom since all shares are still held by Rosneft.\nExamine the possible outcomes for each combination: \nIf we include Yugansk, total oil production under foreign control would be 16%, which is below the 15% set by the UK. \nIf we consider only Gazprom and Rosneft, it meets the requirements of both the rules but still leaves Russia's total oil production at 10%.\nBy eliminating the combination that doesn't meet either rule and considering the remaining options, it becomes clear that including Yugansk is not an option as per the UK's requirement.\nAnswer: The merger should include only Gazprom and Rosneft for Russia to achieve its objective of having majority control over Gazprom without breaking any rules. \n", "orca-mini:3b": " The merger of Russian gas giant Gazprom and oil firm Rosneft is set to proceed, but will exclude Yugansk, which was controversially acquired last year.
