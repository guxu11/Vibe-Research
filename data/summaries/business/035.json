Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nFirst, the headline says WPP profits surge 15%. They had bigger-than-expected profits, reaching \u00a3546m or $1.04bn compared to last year. That's a significant increase. \n\nThen, they mention pre-tax profits rose by 15% from before. Their operating margins are 14.1%, which is higher than the average analyst forecasts of \u00a3532m. They expect that margin to reach around 14.8% by 2006. \n\nWait, what's the difference between pre-tax and after-tax? I think it's just profit before taxes, right? So their margins are based on that. That means they're doing better than others in their industry because of lower tax rates or something.\n\nThey also talk about buying US rival Grey Global, which is a big deal. This makes them look like a bigger company in the sector leader position, Omnicom. That probably helps with market share and growth.\n\nThen, there's some financial news where WPP sold the NOP World market research unit for up to \u00a3350m. I'm not too familiar withNOP, but it's likely an investment firm. They mention recent buys like Ogilvy & Mather and Cordiant Communications. That shows they've been acquiring other big players over the years.\n\nIn 2004, events like the Olympics boosted their profits. That makes sense because ads for sports can be good. Also, the FIFA World Cup might have attracted attention with sponsorships or promotions. \n\nLooking ahead, WPP says media and technology are strong in the US economy, which is a positive sign for their advertising business. They expect long-term growth as these factors continue to develop.\n\nSo putting it all together, I need to make sure I cover the profits increase, margins, strategic buys like Grey Global, NOP sales, 2004 success from Olympics and FIFA events, and the long-term outlook driven by media and tech. Also mention that WPP is a big player in global advertising despite some political costs.\n\nI should avoid any explanations or formatting, just plain text summarizing all key points.\n</think>\n\nWPP's profits saw a 15% surge to \u00a3546m, up from last year's \u00a3532m.
