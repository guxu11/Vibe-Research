Deutsche Bank maintains the case has no place in a US court because Yukos has no assets in the US, apart from two bank accounts and a house in Houston owned by its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore. Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. It had agreed to loan Gazpromneft the money to bid for Yugansk.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says that the bankruptcy isn't about U.S. matters at all. That means Yukos is facing legal issues outside the US.\n\nThen there's mention of Russian authorities not following any U.S. court decisions related to their troubled oil company, Yukos. It says something about a court being told this information but doesn't give details on how they're handling it.\n\nWilliam Butler, a legal expert, says there's no treaty between the U.S. and Russia for their legal rulings. That means Moscow won't have to obey US rulings in Yukos' case because of that lack of treaty agreement.\n\nYukos filed its Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Houston in December, but it was a mistake because they were trying to stop the sale of Yugansk. It sold it to someone else to pay back a $27.5 billion tax bill. They bought it for $9.4 billion and the buyer wasn't state-controlled.\n\nDeutsche Bank and Gazpromneft are suing them. They're involved because they own some parts of this company. Deutsche Bank says the case doesn't go into the U.S. court because Yukos has no assets there, apart from two bank accounts and a house in Houston. They also say they had to consult with other sources like Boris Solzhenikov.\n\nUS bankruptcy judge Letitia Clark is still ruling, but she'll probably do so before next Tuesday, though she hasn't ruled on it yet.\n\nYukos claims that Russian courts weren't favorable or didn't offer much protection. It's part of a campaign to destroy their company and the person who ran them down, Mihkail Khodorkovsky, in Russia for fraud and tax evasion. They're suing Russia elsewhere in Europe and U.S., seeking financial damages.\n\nI think that covers all the main points. Now I need to condense this into a concise summary without any extra info or explanations.\n</think>\n\nYukos Bank's bankruptcy case is not linked to the United States, despite the involvement of Russian authorities. The court has not been involved in U.S. legal decisions regarding Yukos, which faces significant financial loss from the sale of Yugansk and tax bill payment. A bankruptcy filing was an unsuccessful attempt to halt the sale of Yugansk. Two companies, Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, are suing Yukos for avoiding a U.S. court's ruling on its lack of assets in the U.S., apart from bank accounts and real estate. The case has faced legal challenges from sources including Boris Solzhenikov, who is suing Russia as well. US judge Letitia Clark will rule on the case but hasn't so far, and Yukos claims Russian courts were unfriendly or lack protection. The company is also seeking financial damages in Europe for Russian involvement and another $20 billion in a U.S. lawsuit against Rosneft.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "A Houston court has ruled that Russia does not have to follow any US court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant Yukos, as there is no treaty between the two countries to recognise each other's legal rulings.

The American subsidiary and local bank accounts of Yukos were not involved in the sale of its main oil producing unit, Yuagansk, to Russian authorities. In turn, Deutsche Bank was part of the US court's jurisdiction because it was involved in the case because it finances Gazpromneft, a company that is also being sued by Yukos for losses and damages.
