{"raw_text": "High fuel prices hit BA's profits\n \n British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.\n \n Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of \u00a375m ($141m) compared with \u00a3125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by \u00a3106m or 47.3%. BA's profits were still better than market expectation of \u00a359m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.\n \n To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.\n \n In October, it increased this from \u00a36 to \u00a310 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from \u00a32.50 to \u00a34 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - \u00a3160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra \u00a3250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to \u00a31.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.\n \n It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "High fuel prices caused British Airways' profits to drop by 40% over the three months to December 31, 2004, despite making a pre-tax profit of \u00a375m.\n\nFuel costs rose by \u00a3106m or 47.3%, and BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues were \u00a3160m, which was below its predicted extra fuel costs of \u00a3250m.", "llama3.2:3b": "British Airways reported a 40% drop in profits to \u00a375m due to high fuel prices, citing a \u00a3106m increase in fuel costs.

Let me read through it carefully first.\n\nThe main points seem to be about British Airways facing higher fuel prices and how that affected their profits in 2004. They had a 40% drop in profits, which is significant. The report mentions specific increases in fuel surcharges for long-haul flights. There are also some financial figures: pre-tax profit of \u00a375m, which is better than the \u00a3125m from a year ago. They expect full-year revenues to improve.\n\nThen, BA introduced a fuel surcharge starting in October. For one-way flights, they went from \u00a36 to \u00a310 and \u00a32.50 to \u00a34 per leg. This could have helped offset the price increase of aviation fuel. However, according to an analyst, their projected revenue surcharges might still not cover the extra fuel costs.\n\nLooking ahead, BA's profits are expected to rise in 2005 because they're lowering prices and investing in new planes like the Club World flat beds. They have a chairman who said their full-year guidance is slightly better with up to a 3.5% improvement. Their revenue should be better than previously forecasted.\n\nThere was also a positive shift with passenger numbers increasing by about 8% in January, which they attribute to the surcharges and cargo development. BA has cut jobs due to cost-cutting measures from the US attacks in 2001, but they're continuing investments in planes like the A321 and Club World.\n\nFinally, their stock price went up slightly. I need to capture all these points without getting too detailed. I should make sure key numbers like 40% drop, \u00a375m profit, \u00a3125m before are included. Also mention the surcharges, expected revenue increase, improved profits, and any recent changes in passenger numbers.\n\nI think that's everything.
