{"raw_text": "Optimism remains over UK housing\n \n The UK property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown, according to mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey.\n \n B&B said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market. The comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to \u00a3280.2m ($532m). Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to \u00a3450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected.\n \n Recent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth. Last week, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning.\n \n But B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating, the sector \"continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market\". Overall, B&B said that \"housing market fundamentals remain strong\". \"Interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels, real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term.\" Despite the upbeat tone, shares in B&B were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth.\n \n Wimpey's profit figures came in at the top of expectations, with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the US offsetting a slight slowdown in the UK. Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved \"challenging\" last year. \"By late summer, the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn,\" it added. However, the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs, Wimpey said. \"Visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations.\" Shares in Wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "The UK property market remains robust despite recent slowdowns, with mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey reporting growth rates above those of the wider mortgage market.

B&B says it's growing faster than the mortgage market, while Wimpey's profits are up due to strong US sales offsetting a UK slowdown.\n\nThird, there's a statement from CML indicating that buy-to-let mortgages could wane after several years of growth, as the market has cooled.\n\nFourth, B&B mentions their 22% share in the market but notes that despite moderate growth rates, the sector continues to outpace the whole mortgage market. They also mention housing fundamentals are strong and talk about interest rates and unemployment likely staying low.\n\nWimpey's profits were within expectations because of strong US sales. However, they're worried about future earnings growth, which is why their shares are down by 4%. Wimpey mentioned that the UK market was challenging last year but showed signs in the first seven weeks that could be positive.\n\nLastly, Wimpey says that visitor levels and interest are strong, with new home reservations higher than expected.
