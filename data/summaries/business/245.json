{"raw_text": "The 'ticking budget' facing the US\n \n The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial. The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, which tends to be critical of the President, looks at possible fault lines. US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund. As soon as 2018, the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits.\n \n The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output.\n \n This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad. The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations. This does not bode well for US influence in the world. The decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. The dollar is already sinking. Before too long, credit markets are likely to react, and interest rates will creep upwards. That will be the shock.\n \n Interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing, automobiles, other consumer durables, agriculture, and small business. Some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the US Capitol in the late 1970s. There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. The public outcry will force Congress to act. Whether it will act wisely is another matter. How did this happen?\n \n By definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation. Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. In addition, the United States has two significant military missions. The Bush administration's chosen remedy is the least feasible one. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating \"waste, fraud and abuse\" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left. Law enforcement, space exploration, environmental clean-up, economic development, the Small Business Administration, housing, veterans' benefits, aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. It's fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor. To some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable. The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. But serious savings can only be found where the big money is. Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private. Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation's elderly and indigent.\n \n On the revenue side, the lion's share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced.\n \n Some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. Finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. There is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway. Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. Borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. The sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. First on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue, simplify the tax code, and restore some fairness eroded by the Bush tax cuts. Second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years, much of it unrelated to Afghanistan, Iraq, or terrorism. Third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform.

Bush. The user wants only a concise summary, no explanations or formatting. Let me read through the text carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be about the budget being controversial because of cuts and spending issues. It mentions the Economic Policy Institute pointing out possible fault lines. They talk about large federal budget snatches leading to train wrecks, especially since federal debt is rising fast and putting upward pressure on interest rates. There's a call for immediate action as industries suffer from cuts in housing, cars, etc.\n\nThen it mentions how the deficit isn't just revenue minus spending; it's too low if revenue doesn't go up enough. They talk about military missions, potential rewrite of the budget by Congress not being wise. The dollar is on the decline, and saving money might be hard unless you focus on certain areas like healthcare or education.\n\nThere are also mentions of tax cuts, changes in defense spending, and the need for reform in public services. The conclusion is that a balanced budget isn't effective in the modern economy and that immediate changes are needed to prevent issues.\n\nI need to capture all these points concisely without getting bogged down by minor details. Let me try structuring it into three main sections: the problem with cutting, the current state of the budget, and the call for reforms.\n</think>\n\nThe U.S. federal budget is highly controversial due to ongoing cuts and spending issues, exacerbated by rising federal debt. The Economic Policy Institute finds fault lines, while large cuts in small programs are expected.

In this article, political economist Robert J. Gordon examines how the Bush administration's budget proposals are likely to affect the country's ability to finance its operations, financing of consumer spending and investment in domestic infrastructure. The upward pressure on interest rates faced by the US government is also discussed, with the author highlighting that the decline of the dollar is already being felt in key sectors such as housing, automobile manufacturing, agriculture, small businesses, and consumer durables. Furthermore, the author points out that the current economic slump has led to calls for increased borrowing, but these are unlikely to be met with consensus from Congress or central banks. The author's warning of a \"ticking budget\" crisis is based on the premise that the current system cannot continue to finance its operations without large borrowing.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " In response to the given text, it is crucial to first understand that the Bush administration's proposed budget is heavily criticized due to its lack of fiscal responsibility. The primary issue highlighted in the summary is the significant increase in military spending and the continued reliance on borrowing as a way to balance the federal budget.\n\nFurthermore, the text emphasizes that without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the US federal budget will simply not be able to hold together. As a result of these factors, significant cuts must take place in order to meet projected spending targets. The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute points out that many areas are in need of reform and restructuring to reduce government debt and make better fiscal decisions.\n\nIn summary, the proposed budget by President George W. Bush is heavily criticized due to its large military spending and reliance on borrowing. Critics argue that these measures do not promote long-term economic growth or stability. The US federal government must undergo significant reforms to address these concerns and create a more sustainable and balanced budget in the future.", "phi:2.7b": " The US President's budget proposals have sparked controversy due to their controversial nature.

Cutting spending on essential programs like education, infrastructure, and defense will cause significant harm to the public, while blind allegiance to balanced budget is not necessary.
