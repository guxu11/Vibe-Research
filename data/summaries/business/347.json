This trend can be attributed to both countries easing restrictions on travel and businesses implementing new policies as part of the peace process aimed at ending the conflict.\n\nIndia's export growth has been fueled by the opening up of trade relations, which include sugar, pharmaceutical products, and tea being sold in Pakistan for the first time.
