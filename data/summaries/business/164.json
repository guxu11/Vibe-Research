{"raw_text": "Yukos sues four firms for $20bn\n \n Russian oil firm Yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas.\n \n Yukos is claiming more than $20bn (\u00a311bn) in damages after Yugansk was sold in December to settle back taxes. The four companies named in the law suit are gas giant Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, investment company Baikal, and state oil firm Rosneft. Yukos submitted the suit in Houston, where it filed for bankruptcy. As well as suing for damages, Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator. It also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n \n The clash between Yukos and the Kremlin came to a head last year when Yukos was hit with a bill of more than $27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines. To settle the bill, Russia forced Yukos to sell off Yuganskneftegas.\n \n Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. It also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets. Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for $28.3bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless. In Houston, bankruptcy Judge Letitia Clark will start a two-day hearing on 16 February to hear arguments on whether a US court is the proper forum for the case.\n \n The threat of legal action from Yukos and its bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last year's auction, however. Concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle, Gazprom and Gazpromneft withdrew from the auction, and Yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm Baikal Finance Group. A few days later, Baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main points are that Yukos is suing companies related to Yuganskneftegas, which was part of the Russian oil company. They claim damages from back taxes and unpaid fines, which were big because of Russia's forced auction in December. The suit was filed in Houston, where they're in bankruptcy. They're suing four firms: Gazprom, its unit, Baikal, and Rosneft.\n\nYukos is calling it illegal and wants an international arbitration. They also want the US court to handle the tax dispute and include a reorganisation plan in their chapter 11 filing. There was a bill over $27bn from back taxes and fines, which led to the sale of Yuganskneftegas.\n\nRussia's court didn't have much jurisdiction over Russian companies before this case, but now it does, though they're skeptical. They've withdrawn the auction with Gazprom and its unit leaving, and Baikal has taken control for a sum. Rosneft is merging with Gazprom, and Yukos is saying shareholders were ignored.\n\nSo I need to condense all that into a summary without any extra info or explanations.\n</think>\n\nYukos, a Russian oil company, sued four firms related to Yuganskneftegas, the Russian industry arm of Yukos. They claim $20 billion in damages from back taxes and fines, which Russia forced to settle by selling Yuganskneftegas in December. The suit was filed in Houston for bankruptcy, with Yukos seeking an international arbitration court, and a reorganisation plan included in their chapter 11 filing. Russia's court had limited jurisdiction before the case but now has it, though skepticism remains about its role. Gazprom and its unit withdrew from the auction, while Baikal Finance Group took control of Yuganskneftegas for $9.3bn, with Rosneft merging with Gazprom to regain state control.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "A Russian oil firm, Yukoy (Yukos), has filed a lawsuit against four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit. The companies named are Gazprom, Gazpromneft, investment company Baikal, and state oil giant Rosneft. Yukao claimed more than $20bn in damages as a result of the auction, which they say violated both Russian tax laws and international agreements. The case has been raised for discussion in Houston, where the company filed bankruptcy last year. The legal dispute between Yukao and the Kremlin came to a head last year when they were hit with a bill of more than $27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines. In order to settle the bill, Russia forced Yukao to sell off its Yuankneftegas unit to Gazprom for $9.3bn. The legal wrangling between Yukao and the government is viewed as being legally meaningless by Moscow officials, who have dismissed the case as an attempt to use a US court to regain control of Russian companies.
