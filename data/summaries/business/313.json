Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the paragraph mentions that Petrel Resources' shares have lost more than 50%, which is significant because they were trading at $1.87 and fell to $0.85. That\u2019s a big loss for investors in both Ireland and the U.K. \n\nNext, I should note that the news came from Reuters. They reported Iraq's Oil Ministry awarded the first post-war oilfield contracts to Canadian IOG and Turkish Everasia. So,Petrel didn't hear about this yet.\n\nI need to include details like the timing: by 1700 GMT, the share price dropped from 97p to 44p. Petrel said they haven\u2019t received any information about the report. \n\nThe contracts are worth $500m each. Turkey won one project for the Khurmala Dome field, which produces 100k b/d and has gas separation stations. Meanwhile, Ironhorse Oil & Gas won another contract at $265m to run Himrin's field. The other project is about building flow lines and gas separators.\n\nThe winners are working on new infrastructure but the oil ministry\u2019s choice isn\u2019t final yet because Iraq is studying offers. If they get the contract, it'll be the first foreign deal for Iraq. \n\nI should also mention that even thoughPetrel didn't hear about this dispute, it's a big deal for both Ireland and Britain since oil prices have been falling.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to capture the key points without explanations or formatting. Just a concise summary in plain text.\n</think>\n\nPetrel Resources\u2019 shares fell by more than 50%, trading from $1.87 to $0.85.
