{"raw_text": "Yukos seeks court action on sale\n \n Yukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.\n \n Yukos has said it will sue Baikal and others involved in the sale of Yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a US court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear.\n \n Russian newspapers have claimed that Baikal - which bought the Yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, \u00a34.8bn) on Sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer. Many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of Yukos' oil output, could ultimately fall into the hands of Surgutneftegas or even Gazprom, the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.\n \n The Russian government forced the sale of Yukos' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. Yukos' US lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of US bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. On Wednesday, Yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group. \"We believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us,\" Yukos spokesman Mike Lake told Agence France Press. \"If it exports that oil, it will be marketing a stolen product,\" he added. The future ownership of Yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that Baikal was established as a front for other interests.\n \n Speaking on Tuesday, President Putin said Baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other Russian energy firms interested in the development of Yuganskneftegas. President Putin also suggested that China's National Petroleum Corporation could play a role in the unit's future after signing a commercial agreement with Gazprom to work on joint energy projects.

Let me read through the provided text carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that Yukos is suing the company for $20 billion in damages. They're going to the US court on Wednesday. The main reason they're appealing is because the Russian government ignored a court order last week that blocked the sale of Yuganskneftegas. I'm not exactly sure what Yogos' assets are, but it seems like Baikal's interest in it was being held by Surgutneftegas or Gazprom, which are other big oil companies.\n\nI also notice mentions of Russian newspapers calling Baikal a competitor with links to Surgut and Gazprom. Observers think the unit could end up with those firms instead. There were claims about back tax bill owed by the company, which I guess is related to their current sale.\n\nYukos' lawyers are arguing that the auction wasn't lawful because they filed for bankruptcy. This would affect US bankruptcy law jurisdiction, meaning Yukos' assets might be protected differently. They're also seeking more legal remedies and suggesting political reasons behind their actions, like Mikhail Khodorkovsky's motives. The future ownership of Yuganskneftegas is unclear, with suggestions that Baikal could be a move to destroy the company.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Yukos is suing for financial damages, appealing an illegal sale due to Russian interference and potential changes in their assets. They're pushing through legal steps because they think they can't continue doing business without them, which is backed by political reasons.\n</think>\n\nYukos seeks court action against Baikal Finance Group over $20 billion in damages for selling Yuganskneftegas, appealing an illegal sale blocked by the Russian government. The lawsuit aims to freeze Baikal's assets as their current owners might fall into other firms like Surgutneftegas or Gazprom.
