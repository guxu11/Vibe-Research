This move is seen as a significant development in the Japanese banking industry, marking the end of a long-standing rivalry between two major players.\n\nThe decision to withdraw the takeover offer was likely made after careful consideration by Sumitomo's management and other stakeholders. The company has been at the centre of a fierce bid battle over the last year, with Sumitomo's management preferring the offer from MTFG. However, Sumitomo's ability to absorb UFJ and the company's financial stability have given it an edge in negotiations.\n\nThe merger between Sumitomo and MTFG will still need to be approved by shareholders of both companies.

It marks a shift towards more collaborative and strategic partnerships between banks, rather than traditional competitive battles. This development is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the industry as a whole, with potential benefits including increased efficiency, improved risk management, and enhanced competitiveness.\n\nThe merger between Sumitomo and MTFG will also lead to significant changes in the structure of Japanese banking, with both companies expected to benefit from the integration of their operations.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, Sumitomo has withdrawn its offer, which means they're no longer trying to buy or acquire UFJ. This makes sense because if they're not taking the offer, then the merger between them can proceed smoothly without any issues. The deal is a big one worth 3 trillion yen, which is $29 billion. It's supposed to make Japan the world's biggest bank with over 1.8 trillion yen in assets.\n\nSumitomo's announcement was received by UFJ's bosses Friday, which probably helped them take the deal. But wait, there were concerns about Sumitomo's financial health. They had higher valuations than before, so that might have been a risk for them. Their management preferred the offer from Mitsui Financial instead of Mitsubishi. The reason is something about preferring the outcome over shareholders' interests and the company's past integration with MTFG.\n\nMitsubishi's takeover of UFJ was planned to be a big deal but they still need to get their shareholdings approved, so maybe it will be formalized. Now Sumitomo is moving on to work with another bank, Daiwa Securities, which could involve sharing their venture capital operations. This alliance might lead to even bigger mergers or larger banks.\n\nOverall, the key points are Sumitomo's exit from UFJ, a huge merger, the financial health concerns, and Sumitomo seeking new deals.\n</think>\n\nSumitomo Mitsui Financial has withdrawn its takeover offer for rival bank UFJ Holdings in Japan, enabling the latter to merge with Mitsunobu Tokyo. This move clears the way for their 3 trillion yen ($29 billion) deal with Mitsunobu. Sumitomo's decision is expected to lead to a world-renowned bank as UFJ and Mitsunobu combine. However, concerns remain about Sumitomo's financial stability after higher valuations, which could affect shareholders' interests. UFJ management prefers the offer from Mitsunobu Financial Group instead of Sumitomo.

Concerns were raised about Mitsuki's ability to absorb UFJ, but the Japanese banking industry has become increasingly focused on all-out alliances to boost profitability.
