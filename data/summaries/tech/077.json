{"raw_text": "Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\n \n Viruses, trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.\n \n The shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home PCs. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.\n \n The growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.\n \n \"You cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to,\" said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift. Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. \"It's about outright criminality now,\" said Mr Simpson, explaining why this change has come about. He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. Former virus writer Marek Strihavka, aka Benny from the 29A virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. Not least, said Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. \"In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now,\" he said. Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. \"If you think of criminals they do not do clever,\" said Mr King, \"they just do what works.\"\n \n As the tactics used by malicious programs change, said Mr King, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. Now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.\n \n Many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. As well as using different tactics, criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. \"The main motivation now is money,\" said Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software. Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. With almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. So-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Viruses and trojans are becoming less effective as malware, as tech-savvy criminals turn to technology to con people out of cash, steal data, or take over home PCs.

Many of the virus programs are being written in rarer and more direct ways, making it harder for law enforcement agencies to catch them. The emergence of this new wave of malicious code is seen as a threat not just to individuals but also to large corporations that rely on software for their operations. Criminals use various techniques to infect computers with their malware, from phishing attacks that exploit user weaknesses to sophisticated spyware that can control the machines it infects.\n \nThe increasing use of malicious programs by criminals has led to a shift in how these threats are being addressed. Firms are tightening up their networks with defenses to combat this new wave of malicious code, and this is seen as a result of the ever-increasing sophistication of the attacks themselves. Many of the programs written by criminals roll various technical tricks together into one nasty package, making it difficult for law enforcement agencies to identify and catch them.\n\nThe end of neatly categorizing different types of viruses and malicious programs is a significant change in the way these threats are being dealt with. Previously, many attacks were broadly classified into categories like worms or trojans, which helped law enforcement agencies and security professionals to more effectively combat these issues. However, the rapid evolution of the malware landscape has led to this categorization changing significantly.\n\n\"The most recent threat is not just about showing off technical prowess but also about making money,\" said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at Clearswift. As a result, many of these programs are being written for direct criminal ends and firms are tightening up their networks to combat this new wave of malicious code. Many criminals now prefer to infect computers with their own software rather than using viruses or malware that come from the dark web or underground communities.\n\nIn many ways, this shift in approach is not as dramatic as some would have predicted, but it does indicate a change in the way that criminal threats are being dealt with. With such a high rate of return for infected machines, criminals are now more interested in exploiting loopholes and hiding in e-mail message attachments rather than relying on traditional techniques like phishing or spyware attacks. This new approach may also be more difficult for law enforcement agencies to identify and catch because they rely on different types of data to track down threats.\n\nAs the threat landscape evolves, it is important that companies invest in strong defenses against these types of threats and stay alert to the latest developments in cybersecurity. By working together with their security partners and using the latest tools available, organizations can help to protect themselves from the ever-growing range of malicious programs being used by criminals.", "phi:2.7b": " The shift in the tactics used by viruses, trojans, and other malicious software is due to tech-savvy criminals using technology to con people out of money or steal valuable data.
