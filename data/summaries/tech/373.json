{"raw_text": "Software watching while you work\n \n Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled.\n \n Worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. The developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. But privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software.\n \n The system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists BridgeHead Software. They have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity, store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. More and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. Sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) A survey conducted on its behalf by NOP found evidence that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. BridgeHead Software has come up with techniques to prove, to a legal standard, that any stored file on a PC has not been tampered with. Ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the Freedom of Information Act, which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time.\n \n The storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. Potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party, copied, printed, deleted or saved to CD, floppy disk, memory stick or flash card. Other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography, the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. Increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data, such as governments, are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. Privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee's privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. \"That is not the case,\" said Tim Ellsmore, managing director of 3ami. \"It is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof,\" he said. \"People need to recognise that you are using a PC as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data,\" he added.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Software monitoring employee activity at work is being developed, with implications for data privacy.\n\nThe software can monitor every keystroke and action performed on a PC in real-time, potentially creating legally binding evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nDevelopers claim it will help prevent cybercrime and sabotage, while critics worry about invading employees' privacy.", "llama3.2:3b": "A new software system has been developed to monitor employees' computer activity, which can be used as legally binding evidence of wrongdoing, prompting concerns about employee privacy and employer-staff relationships.

The system's development stemmed from the Freedom of Information Act requirement for companies to keep all data for a certain period.

The user provided a pretty detailed passage about software monitoring, its implications for employers and privacy concerns.\n\nFirst, I'll read through each sentence carefully. It's talking about a new software that can monitor keystrokes and other actions at a PC, but it can also be used as evidence against wrong-doing. The passage mentions the worries about cybercrime and sabotage prompting companies to use this software. The developers claim it's a breakthrough in data monitoring.\n\nNext, privacy advocates are concerned because the system is invasive. It says that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of cybercrime. They're using techniques to prove stored files weren't tampered with legally. There's an Act requiring companies to store data for a certain time, so the software was developed in response to that.\n\nThe system logs every action on a computer, including things like e-mails, downloads of pornography, and copying applications without permission. This can help employers trace stolen files or identify who used particular machines. However, organizations handling sensitive data are switching to biometric logins, which is seen as better privacy because they track physical actions.\n\nThe managers mention that while the software preserves employee privacy, it still affects the employer-staff relationship. They stress legal requirements about storing data legally and the need for proof during negotiations.\n\nI'll have to make sure each key point is included concisely: software's purpose, benefits for employers, concerns with privacy, technologies involved, companies affected, and the balance between monitoring and privacy.\n</think>\n\nSoftware that can monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC also serves as legally binding evidence of wrongful conduct.
