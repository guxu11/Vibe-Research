{"raw_text": "Fast moving phone bugs appear\n \n Security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs.\n \n The new strains of the Cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. The Cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the Symbian Series 60 phone operating system. Despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of Cabir.\n \n The original Cabir worm came to light in mid-June 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. A mistake in the way the original Cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time.\n \n However, the new Cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range Bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. Bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. The risk of being infected by Cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. Users can protect themselves by altering a setting on Symbian phones that conceals the handset from other Bluetooth using devices. Finnish security firm F-Secure issued a warning about the new strains of Cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. All they do is block normal Bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. Anti-virus firm Sophos said the source code for Cabir had been posted on the net by a Brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. So far seven versions of Cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious Skulls program that was found in late November.

The user wants me to summarize it concisely, focusing on the key ideas and details. Let me read through the text first.\n\nThe original Cabir bug appeared in June 2004 as a proof of concept for an anti-virus firm. It infects one phone at a time because of a bug that wasn't secure. Now, new strains use short-range Bluetooth to reach any device in range and spread faster. Bluetooth has a longer range than radio tech.\n\nThey mention Symbian Series 60 phones using this, which are popular brands like Nokia, LG, Lenovo, etc. F-Secure warned about the risk but said the virus doesn't damage the phone; it just blocks Bluetooth and drains battery. Sophos is worried about more versions being created from a Brazilian programmer's source.\n\nThere were seven Cabir strains known by now, with one inside Skulls. Symbian's Series 60 phones are licensed in several countries. No reports of infection yet despite warnings.\n\nI need to condense this into a summary without explanations or formatting. I'll list the main points: original appearance, short-range Bluetooth for spread, risk reduction by F-Secure warning, recent update about seven strains known, and Symbian's licensing status.\n</think>\n\nFast-moving mobile phone viruses, Cabir, appeared in mid-June 2004 as a proof-of-concept program.
