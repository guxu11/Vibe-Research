{"raw_text": "Microsoft debuts security tools\n \n Microsoft is releasing tools that clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware.\n \n The virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to Microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. Also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. Although initially free it is thought that soon Microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool.\n \n The anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. Microsoft's Windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. It has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100,000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. Latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. Spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers, often without users' knowledge. In its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. The most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. Surveys have shown that most PCs are infested with spyware. Research by technology firms Earthlink and Webroot revealed that 90% of Windows machine have the malicious software on board and, on average, each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. Before now Microsoft has left the market for PC security software to specialist firms such as Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro and many others. It said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. On spyware freely available programs such as Ad-Aware and Spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. Microsoft's two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. In 2003 it bought Romanian firm GeCAD Software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. In December 2004 it bought New York-based anti-spyware firm Giant Company Software. Last year Microsoft also released the SP2 upgrade for Windows XP that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Microsoft is releasing new tools aimed at cleaning PCs of viruses and spyware.

The user wants a summary of a text about Microsoft's new security tools. They provided a detailed passage with several key points. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main ideas. Microsoft is introducing two new security tools: one for catching viruses and another for detecting spyware. These are part of their broader strategy to update their virus-fighting program monthly before releasing dedicated software.\n\nThe user specified that only the summary in plain text is needed without any explanations or formatting. So, I need to make sure it's concise but captures all important details.\n\nLooking at the text, the main points are:\n1. Microsoft is launching tools to combat viruses and spyware.\n2. The virus tool updates monthly and will eventually release dedicated software.\n3. A spyware utility is also being released now.\n4. The anti-spyware tool is free initially but expected to cost users later.\n5. Windows has been a target due to its ubiquity and vulnerabilities, with over 100,000 viruses and spyware.\n6. New viruses are being created at a rate of up to 200 per week.\n7. Spyware can be sneaky but mostly benign, providing ads or hijacking settings.\n8. Most PCs have spyware on them.\n9. Microsoft's security tools are now used by firms like Symantec and McAfee.\n10. They bought GeCAD and Giant to get anti-virus tech.\n\nI need to condense all this into a concise summary without adding extra details or explanations. The user didn't mention any specific structure, just plain text, so I'll make sure it's straightforward.\n\nLet me try to put it together: Microsoft is releasing new tools for PC security, one catching viruses and another detecting spyware. These are part of their ongoing strategy, with the virus tool updating monthly and the spyware tool being available now. The anti-spyware tool is free initially but expected to be expensive later. Windows has many malicious files, and users can get these tools from reputable companies like Symantec.\n\nWait, that might lose some details about the acquisition part. Maybe I should include that they acquired GeCAD and Giant in 2003 and 2004 respectively. That adds more context but isn't necessary for a concise summary. The user's query doesn't specify including technical details beyond key points, so perhaps it's better to stick to the main info.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that each sentence flows logically without being too wordy.
