{"raw_text": "Broadband soars in 2004\n \n If broadband were a jumbo jet, then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway, firing up its engines and preparing for take-off. But this year has seen it soar.\n \n In the spring it literally took to the skies as Lufthansa and British Airways trialled it on flights. This perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology, rather than how useful sky-high broadband would actually be. It was flying high and by the autumn, five million Britons had signed up for high-speed net access at home.\n \n Such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million, or more than 30% of homes. The two key factors in whetting people's appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push. When operators such as BT and Telewest offered standard 512K broadband for less than \u00a320 at the beginning of the year, it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached - broadband had truly gone mass market. A feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take-up of dial-up. Broadband for less than \u00a310 was even touted by some firms, although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models.\n \n For those who became broadbanders in 2004 there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities. The rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access, to the tune of 100 million connections worldwide by April, prompting research firm Point Topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever. By September, the number of broadband connections in the UK finally overtook dial-up and in December BT announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds.\n \n Broadband was being mentioned on the 10 O'clock News and in the tabloids; the Sun even carried a cartoon joke about it. But two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines. In May, BT quietly announced that it was shaving 70% off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges, so-called local loop unbundling. The vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes. At the moment BT has a stranglehold on more than 80% of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what ADSL products get into homes. With cheaper local loop unbundling, rivals to BT can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise-like. It will mean the UK will finally catch up with countries such as France and the Netherlands, where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15Mb (megabits per second). And the major price fall means that, rather than just talk about it, companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into BT's exchanges. It may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the Northern Ireland peace talks - fraught, bitter and with no end in sight.\n \n Another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of BT's reach, meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband, regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived.\n \n There was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1Mbps broadband, they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband-enabled exchange. For thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology, the news meant they could finally join in. Broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators NTL and Telewest also had a bumper year. The biggest news for them was increased speeds, introducing 2Mb and 3Mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512K. The cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route. Broadband can seem confusing for consumers, with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products, some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set-up fees. It is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains a plane worth catching. As it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online, the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Broadband soars in 2004 due to falling prices and marketing efforts by operators such as BT and Telewest.

In 2003, the USAF launched a jumbo jet plane that sailed down the runway to fire up its engines and prepare for take-off. However, this year saw broadband soar as it flew high at the end of summer. Experts predict that by the autumn, five million Britons would have signed up for high-speed net access. The key factors in whetting people's appetite were falling prices and a massive marketing push, which brought to life technological advancement.\n\nApart from being seen as outdated and inadequate for today's standards, the benefits of fast internet access continue to raise concerns. Broadband users demand faster speeds that could reach 100 million connections worldwide by April. As research firm Point Topic mentions, it was announced that broadband is one of the fastest growing technologies in recent years. The days of waiting for the modem to kick in started to seem outdated as companies began to acknowledge its potential and start to move forward with its business models.\n\nIn contrast, other emerging tech trends such as 10Mb or even 1.2Mbps, were announced earlier this year. Moreover, a growing number of broadband users have requested increased speeds, with the aim being to reach out to more people globally. It is also worth noting that companies are now being able to negotiate cheaper local loop unbundling contracts.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Broadband's popularity in 2004 didn't stop there. The major news for broadband users in 2004 was items that did not make the headlines. In May, BT quietly announced a shave off cost for allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges, local loop unbundling was introduced. Companies are aiming to create a more efficient system of international communication using faster speeds as it relates to the UK.\n\nThe news also reveals that the rise in broadband users has led to a larger number of new products and services being launched on BT's exchange networks. It is a remarkable transition given that companies can now enjoy the advantages of higher internet speeds without any hindrance.\n\nLooking forward, broadband may see continued growth, although with a different set of challenges. For instance, it is yet to be determined how much local loop unbundling will expand reach even if it is granted by BT. As it continues to gain momentum, consumers may find themselves wanting more from the technology, hence the need for upgrades.\n", "smollm:1.7b": "Broadband soars in 2004", "deepseek-r1:1.5b": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this text about broadband being booming in 2004. Let me read through it first.\n\nBroadband seems to be a big deal now. It starts with talking about people taxiing down runways or firing engines, which makes sense if they're using it for flights. But I remember that in reality, the main thing is how much people feel it's useful.\n\nLufthansa and British Airways trialed broadband on planes in spring, so they thought it was a big deal. It might not have been about the technology being essential but more about people appreciating it. That seems important because people care about connectivity these days.\n\nThe enthusiasm from signing up at home grew to 5 million in autumn, which is good. But I wonder why that number isn't higher? Maybe because the government was pushing for a market economy where everyone benefits. Experts think this could go up, maybe even more than 8 million by next year, since some companies are trying to undercut lower prices.\n\nBack to BT and Telewest offering free low-speed broadband in the beginning. They made it seem like it's mass-market now. People were surprised that other operators couldn't access their exchanges without extra fees. That was a big deal because it changed how fast internet was being offered.\n\nThere are two main issues: falling prices due to local loop unbundling and the need for people to live close enough. Even though BT took the easy lane, others like NTL and Telewest still had options with different speeds and contracts. This made things confusing for consumers in 2004, and experts expect it might get easier by 2005.\n\nI should mention that even though prices went down, the technology's benefits overtook costs in the UK. They started catching up to other countries like France and the Netherlands, which had speeds up to 15Mb. Also, BT extended their reach to 95% of the population, making them a major player.\n\nThere are some headlines too, like the Sun carrying jokes about broadband. But the key messages were about how technology can make life faster everywhere, even if it's confusing for some people at first.\n\nI need to keep it all in one concise summary without explanations or formatting. Just plain text.\n</think>\n\nBroadband in 2004 saw a boom that transformed connectivity, with significant uptake on highways and flights. Lufthansa and British Airways trialed broadband early, highlighting public appreciation rather than its essential role. By autumn, 5 million Britons signed up at home, a surge unlikely to ease. Experts predict broadband could rise to over 8 million by next year, though some companies offered lower rates.\n\nKey innovations: affordable low-speed broadband from BT in the early stages made it seem market-driven, yet other operators needed fee-based access. This created confusion for consumers until BT extended its reach to 95% of the population and cut local loop unbundling fees to $10, reducing competition. Despite confusion, the technology's benefits overtook costs in the UK, catching up with Europe and becoming a major player.\n\nHeadlines included jokes from the Sun about broadband humor.

The main news for consumers was an extension to the availability of fast broadband services, with NTL and Telewest launching new 2Mb and 3Mb packages at affordable prices. Despite this, cable operators are considering extending their coverage through this route, which could impact consumer decision-making in the future. The news that even smaller cable providers were considering local loop unbundling was a significant development for consumers, providing them with better access to fast broadband services and an easier understanding of pricing and contract terms.
