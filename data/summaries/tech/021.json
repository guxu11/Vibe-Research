{"raw_text": "Britons fed up with net service\n \n A survey conducted by PC Pro Magazine has revealed that many Britons are unhappy with their internet service.\n \n They are fed up with slow speeds, high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17% of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16% are considering changing in the near future. It is particularly bad news for BT, the UK's biggest internet supplier, with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining.\n \n A third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro Magazine. \"We expect these figures to leap in 2005. Every month the prices drop, and more and more people are trying to switch,\" he said. The survey found that BT and Tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. Some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator, making it hardly worth while swapping.\n \n Other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. Broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. \"We discovered a huge variety of problems, but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier,\" said Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro. \"This breaks the code of practice, but because that code is voluntary there's nothing we or Ofcom can do to help,\" he said. There is a vast choice of internet service providers in the UK now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. With prices set to drop even further in coming months Mr Danton advises everyone to shop around carefully. \"If you just stick with your current connection then there's every chance you're being ripped off,\" he warned.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Many Britons are unhappy with their internet service, citing slow speeds and high prices as major issues.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first part talks about a survey by PC Pro Magazine showing that many Britons are unhappy with their net service. They\u2019re upset because of slow speeds, high prices, poor customer service. 17% have switched suppliers, and another 16% are considering changing soon. BT is particularly affected, almost tripling the number of people leaving compared to joining.\n\nThen Tim Danton from PC Pro magazine says that the figures might jump in 2005. Prices drop each month, more people trying to switch.BT is dissuading customers by offering lower prices when they cancel their subscription. Some offered just a tiny bit more than another operator's price, making swapping hard.\n\nOther users are stuck in 12-month contracts due to competition and the need to hold onto customers. They found problems like suppliers withholding info. Danton warns that there\u2019s many choices now, and careful shopping can avoid being ripped off if you stick with your current connection.\n\nI need to capture all these points concisely without any explanations or formatting. Just a summary of key ideas: BT is the main supplier facing high attrition, other providers offer help by offering discounts on cancelation, and competition makes switching hard.\n</think>\n\nBT is the leading internet provider in the UK facing significant churn among users, with nearly triple the number trying to leave compared to joining. Other providers offer discounts when customers cancel, while competition forces users into 12-month contracts, highlighting a competitive market where switching remains challenging.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "The survey conducted by PC Pro Magazine has revealed that many Britons are unhappy with their internet service provider due to slow speeds, high prices, and a lack of customer service. A third of the more than 2,000 people who responded were dissatisfied with their current providers but expect these figures to increase in 2005. The survey also found that BT and TiScala have actively discouraged customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they call up to cancel their subscription. As a result, many Britons are forced to stick with their existing connections while being ripped off, as some broadband packages are set to drop further in coming months. The author advises shoppers to do their research carefully and to shop around for better deals.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " A recent survey conducted by PC Pro Magazine revealed that the majority of Britons are unhappy with their internet service providers, and many have switched suppliers in search of better deals. In a surprising twist, almost half of those surveyed were considering changing their providers in the near future. \n\nBT, the UK's biggest internet supplier, has been particularly hard hit by the shift in customer preferences. A third of its users surveyed were unhappy with their current providers and this could be a harbinger of even more dissatisfaction to come. The low prices provided by BT have been a major factor contributing to its popularity among consumers, but it now appears that these benefits may be set to diminish in the coming years.\n\nThe issue has also raised concerns about the code of practice governing supplier information disclosures. In some cases, providers are withholding this crucial information from customers, a violation of the code. This not only affects consumers but can also have significant ramifications for the industry as a whole.\n\nIn response to these concerns, Ofcom has recently launched a review into the effectiveness of the code and its enforcement. The ultimate goal is to create a more competitive marketplace for internet providers in the UK, allowing consumers to make informed decisions when choosing their provider. \n\nAs a result of the survey results, PC Pro Magazine has suggested that consumers should shop around carefully when making their decision about their internet provider. This not only ensures that they get the best deal but also helps to maintain competition and ultimately lower prices for consumers.\n\nIn conclusion, the net service situation in Britain is far from ideal, with many Britons feeling unhappy with their current providers. Shop around carefully and consider switching to a provider offering better deals, as well as supporting smaller suppliers that are more likely to provide exceptional customer service.", "phi:2.7b": " A survey by PC Pro Magazine shows that many Britons are unhappy with their internet service, citing slow speeds, high prices, and poor customer service.
