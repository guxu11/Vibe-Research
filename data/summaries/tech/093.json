{"raw_text": "The future in your pocket\n \n If you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.\n \n The relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. To begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3G) mobile phones become inescapable. The 3 network launched in 2003, Vodafone launched its consumer service in November, Orange followed in early December and T-Mobile and O2 are due to launch in 2005. The main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up.\n \n Already the extra capacity in 3G networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. But the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. \"Show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and I'll write their obituary\" said Niel Ransom, chief technology officer at Alcatel.\n \n Instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3G phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. Already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. But 3G will not have everything its own way. It will face competition from emerging technologies such as Wimax. This wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. Kent is likely to be the site of the UK's first Wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. Analyst firm Telecom View predicts that Wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3G and will be a clear winner. Bob Larribeau, principal analyst at Telecom View, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as Wimax could dent the possible returns of 3G networks. And the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. The technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers.\n \n Moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.\n \n For a start, BT looks set to roll out its Bluephone project during the next 12 months. The service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. Fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip). Voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. Anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the UK's net using population, can use Voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. Telecommunications regulator Ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for Voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused Voip call services starting up. Home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. If 2004 has been the year of the portable music player, they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. Motorola has just announced a deal with Apple to produce a phone that works with the iTunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. The pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. Some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. Convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. Instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. The only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. But that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "The next 12 months will see the rollout of third-generation (3G) mobile phones, which will offer better deals on voice calls as operators try to attract new customers and retain existing ones. The shift to 3G will also lead to increased competition for other features such as video messaging and multimedia capabilities. Additionally, Wimax wireless technology is expected to disrupt the market, offering faster data transmission speeds and wider coverage, while Voip (Voice over IP) technology is gaining traction with its ability to route calls over the internet instead of a fixed line network.", "llama3.2:3b": "3G mobile phones will become widespread in 2005, offering good deals to consumers due to increased capacity but reducing revenue for operators. The technology faces competition from emerging technologies like Wimax, which can boost data transmission speeds and may steal market share. Mobile and fixed phone services are also converging, with new hybrid devices and Voip (Voice over Internet Protocol) services emerging. Portable media players will become more common, and advancements in storage media will lead to smaller costs per megabyte of memory, enabling more functions and capabilities in gadgets.", "gemma2:2b": "2005 will be a year of exciting developments in mobile technology. 3G phones will become ubiquitous, leading to competitive price wars and greater multimedia capabilities.

However, it wasn't until Niel Ransom, a chief technology officer at Alcatel, who publicly supported the growth of mobile networks that a leap forward was realized, marking the year as an industry leader in the era of 3G.\n\nIn this world dominated by conventional tech, mobile phones were only ever seen as an upgrade from their era-2002 analog counterparts. The rise of 3G marked a new era, ushering in a fresh era of digital innovation. Companies like Alcatel and T-Mobile have shown consistent growth in the fast-paced world of smartphone technology.\n\nAlcatel, with its proprietary BT project Bluephone, launched in 2005, which saw their mobile phones turn a profit. The Bluephone offered an innovative Voice over IP service that routed calls via the internet instead of the traditional fixed line phone network, offering superior speed and efficiency for consumers who valued this innovation.\n\nThe company also launched its wireless broadband plans, enabling rural areas to enjoy high-speed internet connectivity without the hefty cost associated with a long-distance phone call. This growth in telecommunications helped to reshape consumer behavior and expand the reach of mobile networks.\n\nAs technology progressed, the world was increasingly dominating by the rise of Voip, which allows for end-to-end communication over the internet. This service was already at its peak as users could dial and talk through the phone network without needing a fixed line connection. However, consumers would face an array of new device functions and hardware capabilities that they were not accustomed to.\n\nThe development in technology also accelerated due to the proliferation of Wi-Fi technology, which offered seamless connectivity with minimal lag or delay. This became increasingly popular as Wi-fi was gaining acceptance worldwide. As Wi-fi grew popularity, it led to the creation of several networks operating in various geographical locations across the globe, bringing an extra advantage for consumers.\n\nThe future of mobile devices appears set to take a leap forward, marking a new era with more innovative technology and a fresh approach to consumer connectivity. However, consumers are still faced with choices as they must choose which features to invest in to stay competitive or turn towards alternative technologies.\n", "smollm:1.7b": "The future in your pocket", "deepseek-r1:1.5b": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this text about 2005 in the mobile phone industry.
