{"raw_text": "Set your television to wow\n \n Television started off as a magical blurry image. Then came the sharpness, the colour and the widescreen format. Now the TV set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future, although those in Europe will have to be patient.\n \n After years of buzz about high-definition TV (HDTV) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world, mainly the US and Japan. If you believe the hype, then HDTV will so wow you, that you will never want to go back to your old telly. \"HDTV is just the latest must-have technology in viewers' homes,\" says Jo Flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the CBS network in the US. All television images are made up of pixels, going across the screen, and scan lines going down. British TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. By contrast, HDTV offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. The result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard TV. But to get the full impact, programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a HDTV set to receive them. Most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. Viewers in Japan, the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea are already embracing the new TV technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound.\n \n But TV viewers in Europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images.\n \n Many high-end European TV programmes, such as the recent Athens Olympics, are already being produced in high-definition. But they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. The prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging. According to consultants Strategy Analytics, only 12% of homes in Europe will have TVs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008. But the HDTV hype spilling out of the US and Japan has spurred European broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. Big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public's attention. The 2006 World Cup in Germany will be broadcast in high-definition.\n \n In the UK, satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006. There is already a HDTV service in Europe called Euro1080. Other European broadcasters, especially in France and Germany, also aiming to launch similar services.\n \n In Britain, digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for HDTV, at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. The communications watchdog Ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the UK switches off its analogue TV signal. For now, broadcasters like the BBC are working on their own HDTV plans, although with no launch date in sight. \"The BBC will start broadcasting in HDTV when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming,\" says Andy Quested, from the BBC's high-definition support group. \"We have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010, which would put us on the leading edge.\" One of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web. The BBC has already dipped its toe into this, including some HDTV content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for PCs. It is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future. According to Mr Quested, this could help put Europe back into the running in the race to switch to HDTV. This is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Here is a concise summary of the text:\n\nTelevision sets will move from blurry images to crystal clear ones starting in Europe but at a slower pace than expected, particularly in countries such as Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn the US and Japan, high-definition (HDTV) TV started off as a buzz but has recently gained popularity with new programs being broadcast in the format.

It highlights that HDTV offers improved picture quality but requires more active lines and pixels for higher resolution. The US and Japan are leading markets for HDTV, while Europe is still in the early stages, waiting for 2008 to fully benefit. High-end European shows like the Athens Olympics use HDTV, though it's on standard TVs. British broadcasters aim to roll out HDTV services, with the BBC already experimenting with web-based features and offering content online.

This is because HDTV offers far more pixels per inch than standard TVs, resulting in larger, sharper images. \n\nThe European Union's initiative to adopt HDTV is largely due to the success of the broadcasting companies in Japan and the United States, who have already introduced this technology to their viewers. By adopting HDTV, European television networks will benefit from improved visual quality and viewer satisfaction. In comparison, standard TVs produce images with only 625 lines of active pixels and about 700 pixels per screen. This can result in pixelation when there are too many pixels on the screen at once, making for uninspiring visuals.\n\nThe United States has also shown interest in HDTV, with CBS, one of the leading broadcasting networks in the US, announcing its intent to introduce high-definition images to viewers across the country. This move will not only provide a superior \"wow\" factor for consumers but it could also boost the appeal of American television programs and stimulate further innovation in the industry.\n\nHowever, there is still a long way to go before everyone in Europe can enjoy high-definition pictures on their screens. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which oversees the production and distribution of high-definition TV content across the continent, recognizes the importance of this technology and has established a task force to work on developing an HDTV standard that will ensure consistency across Europe.\n\nIn addition to adopting HDTV, the European Union is also working on ways to encourage European broadcasters and consumer electronic companies (CEC) to produce high-definition content. By giving a higher priority to high-definition production, these companies can produce clearer images that are more enjoyable for viewers.\n\nOverall, adopting HDTV in Europe is an ambitious goal, but with the right strategy and partnerships, it may become a reality soon.", "phi:2.7b": " The text talks about how high-definition television (HDTV) technology has become more accessible and popular in countries like the US and Japan.
