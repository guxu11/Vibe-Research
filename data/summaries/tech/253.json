{"raw_text": "Fast lifts rise into record books\n \n Two high-speed lifts at the world's tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet's fastest.\n \n The lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall TFC 101 Tower in Taipei, Taiwan. The Guinness Book of Records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on Earth. The lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers' ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed.\n \n In total, the TFC Tower has 61 lifts, 34 of them double-deckers, and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. The TFC 101 Tower is due to be officially opened on 31 December.\n \n The super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds, while ascending their 382m track. The 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). Curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the TFC Tower. The key new technologies applied in the world's fastest elevators include:\n \n \n  - A pressure control system, which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers, preventing \"ear popping\" \n  - An active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations \n  - Streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft \n  \n \n \"The certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative Guinness World Records is a great honour for us,\" said Masayuki Shimono, president of manufacturer Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems which installed the lifts. The first record for the world's fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the Guinness Book of Records in 1955. \"As such, it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition, when the record was 426m per minute, or 25.6 km/h, less than half the speed of the new record,\" said Hein Le Roux, specialist researcher at the Guinness World Records.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence mentions that two high-speed lifts have been recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the fastest in the world because they can reach 17 meters per second. That's a pretty high speed. They take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers up and down, which is super fast. The towers are 508 meters tall, but from the ground it's 34 floors.\n\nThe text also talks about other elevators in the world\u2014like how they're more efficient, using better technology such as pressure control systems, active controls, and streamlined cars to reduce noise. It mentions that these elevators can go up faster than down because the track is wider. Also, the first record was in 1955, so these are some of the earliest and fastest.\n\nI need to condense this into a concise summary without adding any extra information or explanations. I should focus on the key points: the speed, time, location, number of lifts and elevators, and the technologies used. Maybe also include the tower's height compared to others.\n\nLet me structure it by first stating that these lifts are world record-breakers with a 17m/s top speed. Then mention how they take only 30 seconds each direction, which is super fast. The tower itself is over 50 meters tall. Highlight the number of lifts and escalators. Also, note Taipei's height compared to other skyscrapers.\n\nI should make sure it's clear and flows well. Maybe start with the key facts about speed and time, then location, technology used, and finally compare Taipei's height.\n</think>\n\nThe Taipei TFC 101 Tower's two fastest lifts are recognized as world record-breaking elevators, achieving a top speed of 17 meters per second (about 38 mph or 61 km/h) within just 30 seconds each way. The tower is 508 meters tall and spans over 50 meters above other skyscrapers like the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur.

The speed is equivalent to traveling at approximately 38.25 mph (61 km/h) and takes about 30 seconds to reach the top floor of the tower.\n\nThe elevators are equipped with a pressure control system to prevent ear popping as passengers ascend and descend on the tower's 106 floors. The active control system also helps to balance the lift more finely, while streamlined cars were used to reduce noise and vibrations during operation. Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems installed the lifts at a cost of over $27 million.\n\nThe fastest passenger elevators have been an essential part of modern transportation systems since their inception. As such, Taipei's TFC 101 Tower is more than 50m taller than the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, formerly the world's tallest skyscraper.
