{"raw_text": "ITunes user sues Apple over iPod\n \n A user of Apple's iTunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an iPod to play songs.\n \n He says Apple is breaking anti-competition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site. Apple, which opened its online store in 2003 after launching the iPod in 2001, uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the iPod. Californian Thomas Slattery filed the suit in the US District Court in San Jose and is seeking damages.\n \n \"Apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice,\" the lawsuit states. The key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like iTunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market, according to Ernest Gellhorn, an anti-trust law professor at George Mason University. \"As a practical matter, the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims,\" Prof Gellhorn said. Apple has sold more than six million iPods since the gadget was launched and has an 87% share of the market for portable digital music players, market research firm NPD Group has reported.\n \n More than 200 million songs have been sold by the iTunes music store since it was launched. \"Apple has unlawfully bundled, tied, and/or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players, and vice-versa,\" the lawsuit said. Mr Slattery called himself an iTunes customer who \"was also forced to purchase an Apple iPod\" if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment. Apple's online music store uses a different format for songs than Napster, Musicmatch, RealPlayer and others. The rivals use the MP3 format or Microsoft's WMA format while Apple uses AAC, which it says helps thwart piracy. The WMA format also includes so-called Digital Rights Management which is used to block piracy.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "A user of Apple's iTunes music service is suing the company over iPods, claiming they are unfair because only their products can play songs purchased through iTunes.

Let me read through the text again to make sure I understand all the key points.\n\nSo, the user of iTunes is suing Apple because they can't use their iPod to play songs. The user claims that Apple's approach as an online music store has made them separate from other players on the platform. They mention that while Apple sells a lot of iPods and controls 87% of portable digital music players, using their own technology ensures each song plays only on the iPod.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in San Jose by Thomas Slattery, a Californian man who owns an iTunes account. He's suing Apple to stop other music platforms from selling independently, which he says has created a problem because he needs both his tracks and his Apple iPod to play his music. There's also a mention of how the user had multiple copies of their own song formats and Apple's use of MP3, WMA, etc., with NPD Group reporting they've sold over 200 million songs since the launch.\n\nI think I need to capture all these points concisely without adding any extra information. I should mention the main parties (iTunes User and Apple), the reason for the lawsuit, how it affects competition through technology, and the user's perspective that they're forced to buy an iPod. Also, include Apple's position on the technology but point out that while they have a market share, using their own tech has caused issues.\n\nI should make sure each key idea is included: the lawsuit, the unfair restriction on playing music via iPod, Apple's strategy as a single brand in the market, Slattery's perspective, and the user's experience with different formats.\n</think>\n\nA user of Apple's iTunes Music Service is suing the company over an unfair restriction that prevents users from using their own iPod to play songs. The lawsuit claims Apple's approach, which uses technology to ensure each song only plays on its own device, has fragmented the market by creating competition between different music platforms. Thomas Slattery, a Californian man who used an iTunes account, filed the suit in San Jose and sought damages for his forced purchase of an iPod if he wanted to play his music. Apple, which launched both its online store and the iPod in 2001, faces claims that using their own technology has created issues and created competition through different formats like MP3, WMA, and AAC.
