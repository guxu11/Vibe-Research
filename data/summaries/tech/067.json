{"raw_text": "Tough rules for ringtone sellers\n \n Firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks.\n \n The rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. The first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. The rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.\n \n In the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone.\n \n \"If you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,\" he said. To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. This tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. Mr Flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. \"What made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,\" said Mr Flynn. \"People did not know they were being offered a subscription service.\" \"We saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,\" he added.\n \n The swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. The drafting of the new rules was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UK's phone firms. \"Everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,\" said Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox.\n \n \"It's all about transparency,\" he said. \"Consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it.\" \"The consumer has a right to be protected,\" he said. Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. \"The groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,\" he said. The new rules came in to force on 15 January and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said Mr Flynn. Also, said Mr Flynn, Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. \"We have quite draconian contracts with firms,\" he said. \"We do not have to say why. We can just cut them off.\" Under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal \"stop\" command sent via text message. He said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. \"The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,\" said Mr Flynn.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Firms selling ringtones and other mobile extras in the UK may be cut off from phone networks if they fail to inform customers about exactly what services are provided, how to turn them off, and not mislead consumers.\n\nThe rules were introduced by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and UK phone firms to improve transparency in content sales. Firms that flout the rules could have their licenses suspended or revoked.\n\nAt least 10 ringtone sellers have been cautioned for failing to honor the new rules, with some being cut off from phone networks.

Some firms are suspended while cleaning up their service; others have been cut off from some phones altogether due to a \"sub subscription\" situation. In the last few years, many mobile content sellers have started using a strategy called \"subscription services\" by signing up customers for subscriptions that allow them to get multiple ringtones or other phone extras at once instead of buying individual ones. Jeremy Flynn from Vodafone said that some firms were using this tactic in order to make money off their customers, but others had failed to follow the rules and were suspended.

While ringtones have become popular, fierce competition has led some sellers to adopt subscription models that consumers did not realize they were using. This prompted the creation of new industry standards aimed at protecting consumers by ensuring transparency in pricing and service terms. The rules require firms to inform customers about what they are subscribing to and provide a simple \"stop\" command via text message to turn services off, thereby limiting unnecessary spending.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nSo, first, there's mention of new rules for selling ringtones and other mobile extras in the UK. If someone doesn't let customers know what they get or turn off services, they might be banned from all networks. That sounds serious because it could stop businesses forever if they break these rules.\n\nNext, it says that the first month under new rules has seen several firms suspended while cleaning up their act. I should note that at least ten were taken offline in the first month.\n\nThen, there's a history of ringtones and other mobile content becoming popular over the past few years. But now, with fierce competition, it's hard for sellers to reach consumers. Jeremy Flynn from Vodafone mentions how some firms are using subscriptions instead of single-track services to get more cash out of customers. He talks about marketing costs if they don't sign up properly and how the companies that do sign up have to be transparent.\n\nMr. Flynn also says that mobile entertainment forum and other phone firms agreed on new rules, which were drafted by Andrew Bud of Mobile Entertainment Forum. The main idea is transparency for consumers, so they must be told what they're getting into and how to get out of it.\n\nThere's a mention of Zed, another mobile content firm, saying the new system is essential because it helps consumers trust companies that sell ringtones. Vodafone is cutting off some sellers under the new rules, but only up to eight or ten before they can be suspended.\n\nI think I need to include all these points: the new rules, the suspension incidents, the competition affecting firms, the use of subscriptions, transparency required, and the impact on consumers trust.\n</think>\n\nThe UK has introduced new mobile content rules to ban sellers of ringtones and other mobile extras if they don't disclose details or turn off services. This could stop businesses forever. In the first month since the rules, at least ten companies were suspended for adhering to these guidelines. Despite growing popularity, fierce competition makes it difficult for firms to reach consumers. Many started using subscriptions instead of single-track services to earn more. Mr. Flynn noted that while companies faced marketing costs if they didn't sign up properly, transparency was crucial.
