{"raw_text": "Multi-purpose TV aids India\n \n Two-thirds of the world's population, 4 billion people, live on $2,000 a year or less.\n \n You might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer. But that's not the case. Many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a TV. And now, an Indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet. Carnegie Mellon Professor Raj Reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people. The first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and Professor Reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might. \"I come from a village,\" says Prof Reddy, \"I know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns.\" \"There, nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a PC, word processing and Powerpoint,\" he said. \"So it's clear to me that if people wanted to use PCs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice.\"\n \n Prof Reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach. After all, he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate Indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world?\n \n Instead, Prof Reddy decided to think of those 250 million Indians as a potential market. The problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough. \"It must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this,\" Prof Reddy says. \"People do this today with television sets. If you go to India, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal. Why? Because personalized entertainment has become very important.\" This hatched a completely new idea. He calls it a PCtvt - A personal computer, television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine. Literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control.\n \n On the screen, pictures - not words - designate applications like TV, voice mail, and video e-mail. This dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a PhD. Prassana Rambathla, one of Prof Reddy's graduate students, says that \"when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.' \"It can't choke at any point in time, and it has to withstand anything no matter what you're pressing.\" \"The major part is making it foolproof, very tough, so that it never breaks,\" he says. The Carnegie Mellon team says this project is only possible because PCs are now so much cheaper and have built-in audio and video hardware and software. Limited trials of the PCtvt are due to start this month in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.\n \n Although Andhra Pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net. Prof Reddy has teamed up with Eric Brewer at the University of California at Berkeley. The answer, says Prof Brewer, is wi-fi.\n \n \"We're looking at the thing you'll see in Starbuck's or many other hotspots,\" he says. \"We're doing a lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency, when the power goes up and down, and the links go up and down, and the computers you're connected to just get turned off for no reason.\" Prof Reddy says he hopes to lease the PCtvts for about $10 a month, and thinks Indians will rent the units for the television and DVD capabilities. Reddy says he can then introduce the PCtvt's other technologies - such as video mail. For example, a farmer could use the PCtvt's webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer. Prof Reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off. \"The underlying problem,\" he says, \"is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy, and improve their health care.' \"And what I'm postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them. If I didn't have it, it would be an uphill battle. Even with the technology it's an uphill battle. But I have a tool. There is hope. I can reach them in ways that have not been possible before.\"\n \n Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Multi-purpose TV aids India\nTwo-thirds of the world's population lives on $2,000 a year or less\nA computer engineer thinks he can give people in developing countries cheap access to the internet with a PCtvt - a personal computer, television, and telephone all in one.", "llama3.2:3b": "A computer engineer has developed a device called PCtvt that combines a personal computer, television, and telephone into one unit, designed to be accessible to people in developing countries who cannot afford traditional computers.

First, let me read through the provided text carefully.\n\nThe user wants a concise summary that captures key ideas and details. They also specified not to include any explanations or formatting beyond plain text. So my task is just to extract the main points without adding anything else.\n\nLooking at the text, it starts by mentioning that two-thirds of the world's population, which is about 4 billion people, live on $2,000 a year or less. That's an important statistic because it sets the context for why technology like TVs and computers are relevant to many people.\n\nThen it talks about how in developing countries, people often give up one meal to buy a TV set or computer. This explains the problem that Raj Reddy is trying to solve, highlighting his motivation from the perspective of those who struggle with basic needs like food.\n\nRaj Reddy, a computer engineer from India, has spent a lot of time thinking about why poor people would want technology and he came up with a specific idea: PCtvt. This combines personal computers, TVs, and telephones into one device that runs on a standard desktop machine. The idea is to make it accessible even to those who are not literate.\n\nHe argues that this approach is different from traditional aid packages because it's more about personalized entertainment rather than providing expensive technology to large populations. He mentions that illiterate users need 100 times more power and memory than a computer designed for educated users, which makes the device much harder to build, but he says it's worth it.\n\nPrassana Rambathla is mentioned as an example of someone who might use this PCtvt, especially in areas where traditional TV sets aren't available. He notes that the device uses pictures instead of words and depends on audio and video hardware, which can be a challenge because they have to handle multiple signals without losing quality.\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon University team is collaborating with Eric Brewer from UC Berkeley to develop this project. They're targeting states like Andhra Pradesh in India, where infrastructure might not be as advanced as globally available technologies but are starting to work on wireless networks, which can provide reliable internet despite issues like intermittency.\n\nProf Reddy's goal is to make the PCtvt affordable and accessible, potentially using $10 a month for its units. He also plans to introduce other features like video mail, allowing individuals to send video content like cameras directly to others. The real benefit seems to be in communication technologies that can connect people who might not have traditional access to media.\n\nThe text concludes by framing the underlying problem: improving quality of life and reducing poverty through technology. Raj Reddy's PCtvt is seen as a breakthrough solution, suggesting he has a tool that others haven't yet had access to.\n\nI need to condense this into a summary without losing any key points. I'll make sure to include Raj Reddy's name, the main idea of combining personal computers, TVs, and phones, his motivation for targeting poverty areas, the challenges involved, the tech team's efforts, and his vision of how it could impact daily life.\n</think>\n\nRaj Reddy, a computer engineer from India, developed the PCtvt (Personal Computer, Television, and Telephone) device.
