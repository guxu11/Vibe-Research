Diehard fans of Bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings. The game is weak, not completely unplayable. Then again, 007 fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras.

They mention that the game is a reimagining of a 1964 film, using a portly character named Auric Goldfinger. It's not related to the original GoldenEye theme song but instead sets the tone with an injury and golden eye effect.\n\nThe second paragraph discusses how the game follows James Bond initially, dealing with a character he kills off quickly, leading to a plunge in altitude.

They mention that recent games like Nightfire and Everything Or Nothing were good, so this one isn't bad either.\n\nThey talk about the graphics\u2014clarity issues and strange enemy AI\u2014but the levels are noisy and chaotic.
