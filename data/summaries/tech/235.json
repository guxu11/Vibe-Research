{"raw_text": "Internet boom for gift shopping\n \n Cyberspace is becoming a very popular destination for Christmas shoppers.\n \n Forecasts predict that British people will spend \u00a34bn buying gifts online during the festive season, an increase of 64% on 2003. Surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising, as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online. Savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in High Street stores.\n \n Almost half of the UK population now shop online according to figures collected by the Interactive Media in Retail Group which represents web retailers. About 85% of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their Christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group. On average each shopper will spend \u00a3220 and Britons lead Europe in their affection for online shopping.\n \n Almost a third of all the money spent online this Christmas will come out of British wallets and purses compared to 29% from German shoppers and only 4% from Italian gift buyers. James Roper, director of the IMRG, said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as LCD television sets and digital cameras. Mr Roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for Christmas. He advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular. A survey by Hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents, such as lingerie, for wives and girlfriends. Much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time, according to research carried out by security firm Saint Bernard Software. The research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer. Worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket, suggests the research, who will spend up to five hours per week in December browsing and buying at online shops.\n \n Iggy Fanlo, chief revenue officer at Shopping.com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping. \"When you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher,\" he said. Higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster, he said, which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy.\n \n The behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said. \"The single biggest reason people went online before this year was price,\" he said. \"The number one reason now is convenience.\" \"Very few consumers click on the lowest price,\" he said. \"They are looking for good prices and merchant reliability.\" Consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service. Data collected by eBay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site. According to eBay UK there are now more than 150 Robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site. The Robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores. Similarly many shoppers are turning to eBay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline PlayStation 2, which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle. The high demand for the PlayStation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up. In shops the PS2 is supposed to sell for \u00a3104.99. In some eBay UK auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure. Many people are also using eBay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country. The portable version of the PlayStation has only just gone on sale in Japan yet some enterprising eBay users are selling the device to UK gadget fans.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "British internet users will spend \u00a34bn online during Christmas, an 64% increase from 2003.

The increasing popularity of online shopping among consumers can be attributed to several factors, including:\n\n1. **Convenience**: Online shopping allows consumers to shop from the comfort of their own homes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without having to physically visit a store or wait in line.\n2. **Wider selection**: Online retailers can offer a wider range of products and services than physical stores, which are limited by space constraints.\n3. **Price comparison**: Online shoppers can easily compare prices among different retailers, ensuring they get the best deal.\n4. **Product reviews**: Online reviews from other customers provide valuable insights into the quality and performance of products, helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions.\n5. **Warranty and support**: Many online retailers offer extended warranties and dedicated customer support, which can be more convenient than dealing with physical stores.\n6. **Sustainability**: Online shopping reduces the need for transportation, packaging, and other environmental impacts associated with brick-and-mortar stores.\n7. **Personalization**: Online retailers can use data analytics to offer personalized product recommendations, promotions, and content, enhancing the shopping experience.\n8. **Accessibility**: Online shopping is particularly beneficial for people with disabilities, elderly individuals, or those living in remote areas where physical stores are not accessible.\n9. **Real-time availability**: Online retailers can provide real-time inventory updates, ensuring consumers can track their orders and avoid stockouts.\n10. **Security**: Online transactions are typically more secure than those made at physical stores, with encryption and other security measures in place to protect consumer data.\n\nThe growth of online shopping has also led to the emergence of new business models, such as:\n\n1. **Subscription-based services**: Online retailers like Netflix, Spotify, and Apple Music offer subscription-based models that provide access to a vast library of content or music for a recurring fee.\n2. **E-commerce marketplaces**: Platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba connect buyers with suppliers from around the world, facilitating global trade and commerce.\n3. **Social commerce**: Online retailers are leveraging social media platforms to facilitate transactions, provide customer support, and offer exclusive promotions.\n4. **Augmented reality (AR) shopping**: Some online retailers are incorporating AR technology into their websites or mobile apps, enabling customers to virtually try on products or visualize how furniture would look in their home before making a purchase.\n\nOverall, the Internet boom for gift shopping has transformed the way consumers shop and interact with retailers, offering greater convenience, choice, and value for money.", "deepseek-r1:1.5b": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to summarize this entire text about the internet boom for gift shopping.

Then they mention British people spending \u00a34bn, which is a significant amount, and an increase of 64% from 2003. That shows the growth in gift shopping online.\n\nThey also note that people are buying more expensive goods, on average spending more money each time. The range of goods is expanding too, so it's not just cheaper but a wider variety.\n\nThe key point about savvier shoppers using the internet is that they're finding out about things quickly, likeLCD TV sets and digital cameras leading to better consumer satisfaction. This probably means people are happier buying these big-ticket items online.\n\nNext part talks about half of the UK population shopping online now, with 85% planning significant online shopping this year.

Also, retailers are working hard to reassure people that online shopping is safe. He advises consumers to allow more time for orders when shopping online because it's so popular.\n\nAnother point is about men preferring online shopping, especially avoiding certain types of presents like lingerie. They spend more on the internet, which helps them find good deals. Research from Saint Bernard Software shows losses from staff working from their work computers\u2014up to two days lost and potentially five hours a week.\n\nIgy Fanlo at Shopping.com says that high speeds made online shopping faster and cheaper. People used to spend money in narrowband, but now with broadband it's more accessible. The biggest reason people went online before was price, especially before the internet boom.\n\nNow they mention Robosapiens robots, which were once hard to find online. Some are selling them on eBay. The same for PS2 games\u2014both were expensive and didn't have availability in the UK but some people found them there on eBay. Prices are going up because of high demand.\n\nThey talk about smart shoppers buying these items directly through eBay to avoid stock issues. Also, the portable PlayStation hasn't come out yet but is available in Japan, with some selling on eBay to UK fans.\n\nPutting all this together, I need to create a concise summary that captures all key points: growth in gift shopping, increased spending, happier consumers online, reasons for this change like higher speeds and better price options, behavioral changes towards online shopping, the rise of high-speed internet, reasons for current purchasing trends, and specific examples like PS2 and Robosapiens.\n\nI should avoid any markdown or extra formatting, just plain text.
