Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by handset maker Ericsson. \"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. \"We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,\" he said. \"We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,\" he told the BBC News website.\n \n For the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. \"People's habits remain the same,\" said Dr Bjorn. \"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\"\n \n One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form.

Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into different \"tribes\" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. \"For instance,\" he said, \"older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago.\" This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.\n \n Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.\n \n Once this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. \"Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,\" he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Phone firms should not solely focus on technology features but also consider how handsets fit into consumers' lifestyles. \n\nResearch found that consumers' habits remain the same when it comes to using mobile phones, but the variety of new features allows for gradual change in usage patterns and lifestyles.\n\n Consumers tend to divide into different \"tribes\" based on their phone use habits, with groups like \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" often leading trends in new uses. \n\nEarly adoption is crucial before consumers become complacent about using new innovations, such as cameras or internet connectivity.", "llama3.2:3b": "Research by Ericsson suggests that consumers are more interested in how their phone fits into their lifestyle than just the latest technology features.

Lifestyle 'governs mobile choice' - This sentence highlights that phone firms should not just focus on pushing new technology, but also consider how it fits in with users' daily lives.\n2. Faster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests - The idea that simply providing the latest and greatest technology will lead to increased sales is a common misconception. Instead, phone firms should focus on how their products fit into users' daily lives and provide features that make them want to use their phones more frequently.\n3. Consumer behavior is complex and influenced by many factors - This sentence acknowledges that consumer behavior is not just about the technology itself, but also about other factors such as social norms, personal preferences, and cultural influences.\n4. Interviews with 14,000 mobile phone owners provide insights into how people use their phones - The idea of conducting interviews with a large group of people to understand how they use their phones is a common research method in the field of consumer behavior.\n5. For example, diary-writing among younger people was one way that older people used SMS to stay in touch - This sentence provides an example of how older people may use technology in ways that are different from younger generations.\n6. The sheer variety of what mobile phones can do is driving new habits and lifestyles - This sentence highlights the many different features and capabilities of modern mobile phones, which can drive users to try new things and adopt new behaviors.\n7. Ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into two groups: pioneers and materialists - This sentence provides an example of how researchers may categorize people based on their behavior and attitudes towards technology.\n8. Once this significant number of users have handsets with new innovations, use of new innovations tends to take off - This sentence suggests that once a large group of people has access to a particular innovation, it is more likely to be adopted by others.", "deepseek-r1:1.5b": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to summarize this text about how mobile phone handsets are changing lifestyles. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says that the lifestyle of mobile choice is governed by mobile technology. It's not just hardware; they think consumers care more about how handsets fit into their lives compared to screen size or memory. Then, Ericsson does an in-depth study using 14,000 mobile phone owners. They find that people's habits don't change on their own; it's about moving activities like writing diarys or messaging online into the phone.\n\nThere's a part where Dr. Michael Bjorn mentions that people are still doing what they always do but just use the phone to do it more conveniently, especially with features like cameras in modern phones. For example, younger people write diaries and take text messages, which are easier on mobile devices now because of the camera.\n\nHe also talks about different tribes or groups: \"pioneers\" who try new things and start trends, and \"materialists\" who just follow the trend. Pioneer users like older people might use SMS more because they want to encourage younger ones to try it. And that's why 25% is needed for people not to worry about their messages being seen.\n\nAfter this threshold is crossed, new tech tends to take over. Japan saw camera phones in early reports but didn't do well until maybe 45%. Europe and others are seeing more digital cameras being used daily, like at weddings or birthdays. It's replacing analogue cameras which were just for everyday use.\n\nSo putting it all together, the key points are that mobile tech isn't just about new features; it's about how people use their phones to adapt their lifestyles. There are different groups using it in various ways\u2014some trying new tech and others following trends. Once enough people have these new devices, the trend takes over.\n\nI think I've covered all the main ideas without any formatting or explanations. Time to write this up.\n</think>\n\nLifestyle is increasingly shaped by mobile technology, focusing on how handsets fit into everyday life rather than just screen size or memory. Ericsson's study with 14,000 mobile users revealed that habit habits remain unchanged; people switch activities from digital screens to their phones for convenience, especially with features like cameras in modern devices. Pioneer users (older people) use SMS more as younger ones try it to stay connected. A threshold of 25% purchases leads to adoption without message concerns. Camera and digital camera usage trends take over after this point, replacing analogue cameras which were used daily. Japan's late adoption was due to early camera phones, while Europe and others saw digital cameras taking hold in events like weddings and birthdays, outpacing their analogues.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "The recent research by Ericsson suggests that while mobile phone technologies have always been utilized for different activities, they have started to drive new habit-forming habits among consumers. The study revealed how people's daily activities, including diairy writing and text messaging, are being influenced by the availability of new innovations such as cameras on their mobile phone screens. Ericsson's data shows that while younger users tend to adopt new technologies in a relatively small way, older ones have caught up with them after consuming these devices for some time. Moreover, the survey revealed how camera phones are becoming more prevalent than smartphones and digital cameras among European consumers. In addition, Ericsson noted that while camera phone usage has been on the rise in recent years, it is still not as significant of a trend as that seen for digital cameras in the past.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " The study by Ericsson reveals that the way people use their mobile phones is evolving rapidly. A recent survey of 14,000 users found that while diary-writing remained the most popular activity on their phone, younger generations have embraced the possibility of communicating in a slightly different way using mobile phones. This shift from traditional usage patterns to new technologies is encouraging innovation in different tribes across different areas of life - pioneers and materialists. Dr. Michael Bjorn, a senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab, emphasizes that while these changes might seem incremental, they reflect a fundamental shift in consumer behavior and expectations. Users are now interested in how their smartphones fit into their lives rather than solely focusing on the technology itself. As a result of this trend, new habits and lifestyles are emerging, and Dr. Bjorn predicts that mobile phone usage will change dramatically over the next few years as consumers embrace these innovations.", "phi:2.7b": " A recent study by Ericsson suggests that phone firms should focus less on the features of their handsets and more on how they fit in with consumers' lifestyles. The study found that people's habits remain the same, but using a mobile phone makes them more convenient to do these things.

Consumers can be divided into different \"tribes\" based on their interest in trying new things and adopting new technologies. When about 25% of consumers have handsets with new innovations, such as cameras, usage tends to increase significantly.

The focus should be on helping consumers see how the technology integrates with their daily activities instead of touting the technological advancements for its own sake. According to Dr. Michael Bjorn, a senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab, people maintain their habits and merely transfer those activities into their mobile phones due to their convenience. Consumers can be divided into \"pioneers\" and \"materialists,\" with the former group more interested in trying new things and driving trends while the latter is more inclined to follow existing patterns. The speed of change in mobile phone use depends on the adoption rate among these two groups, with innovations becoming more widespread once about 25% of people have access to them. Dr. Bjorn concludes that usage patterns for digital cameras are now being replaced by camera phones, which are used much more casually and integrated into everyday life.", "chatgpt-4o-latest": "Consumers prioritize how mobile phones fit into their lifestyles over technical specifications, according to Ericsson's research. The study, based on interviews with 14,000 users, found that people adapt existing habits to mobile technology rather than changing their behaviors entirely. For example, younger users use phones for diary-keeping and texting to maintain social connections. Ericsson identified different consumer \"tribes,\" with \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" driving new trends. The adoption of new mobile features accelerates when about 25% of users have them, as seen with camera phones.
