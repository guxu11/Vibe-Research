{"raw_text": "Rings of steel combat net attacks\n \n Gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals.\n \n Many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. But now deep defences are being put in place by some of the UK's biggest net firms to stop these attacks. Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures. \"Net firms are realising that it's not just about anti-virus and firewalls,\" said Paul King, chief security architect at Cisco. \"There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres.\" Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King. This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.\n \n Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said. \"It does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing,\" he said.\n \n So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave. However, he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days. The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. \"It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,\" she said. \"We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,\" said Ms Capella. This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.\n \n Typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. Hijacked computers are known as zombies or 'bots and collections of them are called 'bot nets. Many spammers rent out 'bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail.\n \n Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult. Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. \"The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,\" said Ms Capella. \"We ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning.\" Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. Energis took a similar approach, said Mr Seagrave. \"We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,\" said Mr Seagrave. Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. Information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. He said Energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target. \"We have people in places where they shouldn't be, monitoring tech sites,\" he said. Sometimes though, he said, spotting the next victim was easy. \"You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another,\" said Mr Seagrave.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Rings of steel combat net attacks are becoming increasingly popular among criminals, particularly those who target online betting firms for ransom.

Hmm, let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first part talks about rings of steel combat nets attacking steel structures or something? Wait, no, probably the steel in technology. Maybe they're talking about cyber warfare tactics using physical infrastructure. The key point is that these attacks use data, not just money or human resources. They target online betting sites, which are big and rely on internet transactions.\n\nThen it mentions that many extortionists are threatening to cripple sites with ransom if their attacks get too big. But now companies like Cisco are putting in place defenses against this by installing more security measures. So it's not just about preventing data corruption but also using smart technology for defense.\n\nMr. King says security isn't the only thing being done; there are other network aspects that can protect data centers, like better firewalls and monitoring. He even mentions cyber espionage, where attackers inject viruses or worms into systems to target them later.\n\nIn his opinion, most attacks don't require huge amounts of data\u2014only a few megabytes over short periods. But larger attacks, sending big chunks of traffic, aren't seen very often. He also points out that these attacks can affect multiple sites once they cause a DDoS event because the data flood can hit several networks at once.\n\nMr. Seagrave notes that up to this point, no attack has used gigabytes of data, and while it's not clear if such attacks will happen soon, it seems inevitable. He suggests that attackers are now using thousands of machines from different countries, each contributing a small part of the total traffic.\n\nZombies or bot nets make up these cyber threats. They're based outside the target site, making it hard to stop. Mr. Capella says that when attacks peak, customers receive hits every four days, and they use specialized software to detect malicious traffic before it arrives at the target sites. She mentions that this data can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks use many machines sending small amounts of data.\n\nHe also talks about intelligence gathering\u2014companies are setting up systems to monitor these attacks in real-time, using minutes to identify threats instead of hours of manual work by engineers. They're also working with other companies and individually conducting intelligence to figure out where the criminals plan to target next. He even mentions that sometimes the next victim is obvious alphabetically.\n\nOverall, it seems like companies are investing heavily in security measures but facing technical challenges in defending against massive DDoS attacks. The focus is on both physical defenses and smart data monitoring to protect against these cyber threats.\n</think>\n\nRings of steel combat nets target physical infrastructure for cyber warfare, attacking sites reliant on internet transactions. Extortionists target net-based betting firms using large amounts of data, threatening to cripple sites with ransom if their attacks grow large. However, most attackers send small chunks of traffic, rarely exceeding a few megabytes over short periods.\n\nTo counter these attacks, companies like Cisco have introduced advanced network security measures, including intelligent systems and cyber espionage via viruses or worms. They emphasize the importance of monitoring data streams to detect and mitigate threats, which can affect multiple networks during a DDoS event.\n\nMost cyber attacks involve less than gigabytes of data\u2014small chunks over short periods. However, larger attacks, with significant traffic, are rare but could grow rapidly. These attackers often exploit thousands of machines from various countries, each contributing small parts of the total data flood.\n\nZombies or bot nets, based outside target sites, make it challenging to stop. They are often used by spammers for anonymous email distribution. To detect and block attacks, companies use specialized software to monitor traffic patterns and identify anomalies, which triggers measures to remove attack traffic and maintain site stability.\n\nSmart monitoring systems can detect attacks in minutes instead of hours, using advanced algorithms. Additionally, companies work with other firms on DDoS prevention and gather intelligence for targeting sites. Intensive intelligence programs, including monitoring tech sites, have led to some arrests.
