{"raw_text": "Row brewing over peer-to-peer ads\n \n Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\n \n The debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\n \n He urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\n \n The reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\n \n However Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Row brewing over peer-to-peer ads as music industry and advertisers disagree on legitimacy.\n\nMusic download networks are seen as attractive advertising options due to millions of downloads, but also pose a problem for the music industry which threatens to shut them down.\n\nAdvertisers support peer-to-peer services like eDonkey despite being linked to copyright theft, with Nat West, Vodafone, and Renault among those that have provided funding.\n\nThe British Phonographic Industry (BPI) condemns these links, while companies argue they are not aware of where their ads appear.\n\nMark Mulligan, a music analyst, suggests advertisers can reach target audiences without putting up with the issues, despite the problems for the industry.", "llama3.2:3b": "Advertisers support peer-to-peer networks despite music industry's threats to close them down, while the BPI condemns such partnerships due to copyright theft and financial loss for legitimate artists and labels.

Advertisers value this large, captive audience but face legal concerns about supporting illegal sharing.  The debate centers on the morality of advertising on these platforms while companies like Wippit and OneTel try to disassociate themselves from such connections.

Paul Myers, the CEO of Wippit, argues that advertisers should stop providing file-sharing services like eDonkey to close the platform down for good. This is because many companies support illegal downloading, which threatens the BPI's position as a guardian of intellectual property rights.

They provided an example of how it should look, just a concise summary.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire text carefully to understand its main points. It's about peer-to-peer (P2P) music download networks and how they're being used by advertisers instead of traditional music distribution services like music stores or record labels. The article discusses a study by Paul Myers who thinks P2P services are giving legal support to illegal downloads, which is causing issues with the BPI.\n\nI need to identify the key points: P2P is gaining traction with ads and growing illegal, companies like eDonkey providing paid downloads but also making money from illegal activities. The BPI is opposing this and has some responses to claims it's helping the media buy through its networks.\n\nNext, I should condense these points into a concise summary, ensuring important details are included while keeping it clear and straightforward. I'll avoid any unnecessary jargon or explanations since the user specified no reasoning or explanations. Just plain text.\n\nI also need to make sure that the summary flows well and covers all main ideas without missing any critical information from the original text. Checking each point as I go will help ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me try to outline what needs to be included:\n\n1. P2P is becoming popular, especially among artists who want to use their music.\n2. Advertisers are using these networks for free ads while making money through illegal activities.\n3. Paul Myers supports stopping advertisers on P2P and suggests removing brands involved with eDonkey.\n4. The BPI strongly opposes these practices, particularly after the legal issues involving Napster.\n5. Mark Mulligan mentions this problem has been a concern since Napster emerged.\n6. Advertisers are likely paying more for ads in P2P than respected networks because of the audience's appeal.\n7. Smaller brands might not be aware where their ads go on P2P, but larger ones like big labels have already started leveraging it.\n8. eDonkey is doing well as a result, and its media buying isn't stopping.\n\nNow I'll structure these points into a concise paragraph that covers all the main ideas without getting too detailed. Making sure each point is clear and directly addresses the issues raised in the original text.\n</think>\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) music download networks are gaining traction due to their success among artists, with advertisers increasingly using them for free ads while generating income through illegal activities like file-sharing. Paul Myers, CEO of Wippit, a P2P service, warns that current advertisers on eDonkey, which facilitates illegal downloads, support copyright theft with cash. He calls for companies to remove brands associated with eDonkey and suggestsdumping these brands. Meanwhile, the BPI strongly opposes this practice, emphasizing that any reputable company should review their advertising revenue with legal oversight. Mark Mulligan notes that while smaller brands may not be aware of their ads' target audience, larger brands like senators John Kerry and George W. Bush have already leveraged P2P networks for their media buying. Advertisers are likely paying more for ads in P2P than on respected networks due to the appealing nature of the audience. eDonkey is thriving as a result, while the BPI's stance remains firm against its practices.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "The debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks, which include peer-to-peer ads, continues to rage on as advertisers continue to support these networks. While many musicians and brands are supporting these services through their advertising revenues, some brand names, such as Nat West, Voya, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault, have been accused of supporting copyright theft with real-money payments. Advertisers on these networks are expected to follow suit and boycott illigal download sites by removing ads. However, despite this effort, big brands such as Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush have leveraged the opportunity advertising on eDonkey's network. Peer-to-peer clients offer brand names like these a unique opportunity to engage with customers at their desks, where they are most comfortable.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " The debate over the legality of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and their potential impact on advertising revenue has been a contentious topic for years. In recent months, concerns have risen about the ease with which users can access free music files without paying for them. This issue has led to debates over whether it is appropriate for companies like eDonkey, which provides paid-for music downloads through its network, to support copyright infringement.\n\nOne of the most significant examples of this is the situation surrounding ad networks like eDonkey and its association with illegal file-sharing networks. These networks have gained significant popularity among users who wish to access free music files, without the need for payment. In response to concerns about copyright infringement, Paul Myers, the chief executive of Wippit, a peer-to-peer service that provides paid-for music downloads, believes it is time advertisers stopped providing \"oxygen\" for companies that support illegal downloading.\n\nAdvertisers have been aware of the legal issues surrounding P2P networks since the beginning, but there has been an increasing trend towards advertising on these networks. This has led to a number of companies, such as Nat West, Vodafone and O2, supporting copyright infringement through their advertising revenue. It is clear that the issue with these networks is not just that they facilitate illegal downloading, but also that they represent a very attractive audience. Mark Mulligan, a music analyst for Jupiter Research, believes that this has been a problem for advertisers for a long time. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\n\nThe reality is that millions of users on P2P networks represent a very attractive audience. This makes it difficult for companies to avoid advertising on these networks. OneTel, for instance, has responded to concerns about its adverts appearing on eDonkey by stating that they have investigated this matter and believe that one of their affiliate partners has placed the ad without their knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether the brands involved are aware of where the advertisements are appearing. Similarly, telecommunications firm NTL claims to have strict instructions from its media buying agency not to place ads on P2P networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the issue was brought to their attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to ensure that no ads appear on such sites.\n\nAlthough smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, such as Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush. It appears that these larger companies have the knowledge to prevent this happening, but there are still significant challenges in ensuring the legality of P2P networks and their potential impact on advertising revenue.", "phi:2.7b": " Peer-to-peer music download networks are popular among both music lovers and advertisers due to the captive audience.
