{"raw_text": "Broadband set to revolutionise TV\n \n BT is starting its push into television with plans to offer TV over broadband.\n \n As a telecoms company, BT is moving to a content distribution strategy, Andrew Burke, chief of BT's new Entertainment unit told the IPTV World Forum. \"We want to be an entertainment facilitator,\" he said on the opening day of the London conference. The BBC is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non-licence fee payers overseas. The corporation's Interactive Media Player (iMP) is its first foray into broadband TV - known as IPTV (Internet Protocol TV).\n \n \"We see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers,\" said BT's Andrew Burke.\n \n With more people on broadband, and connection speeds increasing, telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it. Increased competition between net service providers, encouraged by Ofcom, has eroded BT's position in the market. It is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over ADSL a reality. It also sees delivering TV over broadband as a way of getting high-definition (HD) content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional, regular broadcasts. The BBC's iMP has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in 2005. Before it officially launches, the BBC must show the government how it offers value for money. Delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value, says the BBC, because it gives people more control, and more choice.\n \n IPTV is a similar idea to VoIP services, like Skype. Both use broadband net connections to carry information, like video and voice, in packets of data instead of conventional means. Since it uses internet technology, IPTV could mean more choice of programmes, more, more interactivity, tailored programming, and more localised content outside of conventional satellite, digital cable, and terrestrial broadcasts.\n \n It is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and, like personal digital video recorders (PVRs), gives people much more control over TV. Broadcasters see IPTV and PVRs as both as a threat and an opportunity. The BBC recognises that TV over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it, said Rahul Chakkara, controller of BBCi's 24/7 interactive TV services. The iMP is based on peer-to-peer technology, and lets people download programmes the BBC owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast. \"IPTV enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times,\" said Mr Chakkara.\n \n \"So we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for [via the licence fee], they can access it any time they want.\" It helps, said Mr Burke, that people are more au fait with terms like \"digital\", \"interactive\", now that digital TV reaches more than 56% of UK homes. According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales, 30% of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV. They could get IPTV though. Analysts say that IPTV will account for 10% of the digital TV market in Europe alone by the end of the decade. What needs to happen now, agree analysts, is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service; 20Mbps connections would be ideal. BT does not see itself as a broadcaster of IPTV services, rather as an \"enabler\", said Mr Burke. Its strategy is a \"hybrid\" approach, he explained, where over-the-air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband.\n \n Initially appealing to niche markets, like sports fans, it will widen out. But IPTV could be used for home-monitoring, \"pet cams\", localised news services, and local authority TV, too says BT. It even suggests that it could target those households in the UK that do not own a computer, 40% of the country.\n \n Broadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of TV programmes. Home Choice already offers 10,000 hours of shows and channels, delivered over broadband to homes in London. With a broadband net subscription, you can also get your TV and phone service. Through content deals and partnerships, it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels, and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues. It aims to expand nationally, but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its 15,000 subscribers now, and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer. Although still at a very early stage, IPTV is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network - another utility like electricity.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "BT is launching TV over broadband with plans to offer content distribution through a service called IPTV (Internet Protocol TV).

It starts by mentioning BT is moving into TV using broadband (IPTV) over BT's iMP product. Andrew Burke says they want to be a content facilitator and mentions the BBC's efforts in offering IPTV over net and for non-licensing fee payers.\n\nThen, there's talk about increased competition from Net-friendly providers which is causing BT's position to wane. They're looking for revenue growth through IPTV. The BBC's iMP has successful trials and future plans with larger consumer trials. They explain IPTV as a VoIP-like service for content delivery over the net.\n\nAnother important part is how IPTV offers more choice, local programming, and interactivity compared to traditional TV services. It also touches on BT seeing IPTV as a new platform, acting as an intermediary between terrestrial services and IPTV.\n\nThe text mentions that while IPTV could target specific niches like sports fans, it's also applicable for home features such as pet cams or local news. However, not all users might have the right technology. It also talks about the potential of broadband to make IPTV accessible without net access initially.\n\nOverall, the main points are BT shifting TV into IPTV, their current strategy with iMP, the market's competition, and how this service can provide value beyond traditional broadcasting.\n</think>\n\nBroadband is transforming television by enabling content delivery over the internet. BT, a telecom giant, has started offering IPTV, integrating its Interactive Media Player (iMP) to deliver TV content via broadband. Andrew Burke stated they aim as a content facilitator and mention the BBC's efforts in IPTV trials. With increased competition, BT is seeking revenue through IPTV, targeting users with more choice and interactivity than conventional methods. IPTV offers flexibility over net connections, allowing for local and diverse programming.

As a content facilitator for traditional broadcasters and non-telecoms players alike, BT hopes to become a one-stop shop for people looking for a better streaming experience than they can get from conventional television over-the-air (OTA) broadcasts. The company's plan is to offer high-definition (HD) content over broadband and to showcase the technology's potential value through public value tests that are scheduled to run later in 2005. IPTV also offers control over TV, more localized content outside of conventional satellite, digital cable, and terrestrial broadcasts, and enhanced interactive programming. The company sees IPTV as both a threat and an opportunity for change but acknowledges the need for faster connection speeds to handle the service, especially in Europe where only 56% of UK homes get a satellite or digital TV signal.

The iMP launches on October 15th, and will be available initially to a small number of users.\n\nThe iMP, which stands for Interactive Media Player, offers content delivery over broadband technology, known as IPTV (Internet Protocol TV). This service allows viewers to access programs directly through their web browsers, eliminating the need to have a cable or satellite subscription. Users can watch OTA television shows, movies, and other content over the internet, providing greater control and convenience compared to traditional broadcasting.\n\nThe primary reason behind this innovative concept is to offer high-definition (HD) content to viewers who may not have access to conventional, regular broadcasts. BT believes that IPTV will be a major driver of revenue for its Interactive Media Player service and could potentially attract customers who are more familiar with digital media consumption.\n\nThe iMP's primary competition will come from other telecom companies in the UK, such as Sky and Virgin Media. Both of these companies have entered the market with plans to offer TV over broadband, using traditional analogue television signals. While this approach is less convenient for consumers, it offers a cheaper way of delivering content to subscribers.\n\nIn comparison to satellite, digital cable, or terrestrial broadcasts, OTA television provides viewers with more control and convenience. Users can pause, rewind, and fast-forward through programs on their own, making it an attractive option for those who prefer a personalized viewing experience over conventional channels. Additionally, the iMP offers local content as well as international news and entertainment, providing a more diverse range of choices compared to traditional broadcasting.\n\nWhile initial iMP services will be available to a small number of users, the idea behind this innovative service is that it could lead to even greater accessibility and convenience for viewers in the future.
