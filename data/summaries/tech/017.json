{"raw_text": "Finding new homes for old phones\n \n Re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too.\n \n Research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. The Forum for the Future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. But the Forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites.\n \n The report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the UK. Of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year, only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. The slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future. \"It's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around,\" said Mr Goodman.\n \n Many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world, said Mr Goodman. Far better, he said, to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. \"We've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back,\" said Mr Goodman, \"but there's a strong social argument too.\" Older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. \"It's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network,\" said Mr Goodman, \"and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones.\" But the relatively low wages in Romania, which is one of the poorest countries in Europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. \"The affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one,\" he said. Reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of Romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. The re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, said: \"Normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. I am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me.\" \"This is the only way I can afford to have a phone,\" she said. Mr Goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of Britain's mobile mountain made it overseas. But, he added, those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. \"If its more than a few years old people are not going to want it,\" he said.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Old mobile phones can help close the digital divide in developing nations and have social benefits such as reducing waste and providing affordable communication options for people who cannot afford new models.\n\nApproximately 90 million old mobile phones were discarded or wasted in the UK, equivalent to 9,000 tonnes of waste.

About 15 million phones are discarded annually in the UK, with only 25% being recycled. This creates a significant amount of waste that could be harmful to the environment if not handled properly. The report emphasizes the need for phone operators to ensure older phones find new homes through re-use and recycling programs, particularly in countries with limited fixed line networks, where mobile phones are crucial for communication.  Reconditioned handsets have been proven successful, increasing access to mobile phones in Romania due to their affordability compared to new models. \n", "qwen2.5:0.5b": "Old phones can be recycled and reused in developing nations as they offer a useful second life for older devices while reducing environmental impact. More should be done to collect these phones rather than letting them go to waste, especially since the cost of recycling and recovering is lower compared to landfills. The report reveals that an average of 15 million mobiles are discarded every year in the UK, with only about 25% returning to firms for recycling or reusing. The disposal of old phones can cause significant environmental damage and social waste, so it's essential to promote their reuse and recycling.

The environment benefits from reducing e-waste, and social benefits include keeping mobiles accessible for those without access to new models. However, finding ways to repurpose old devices is crucial; the UK alone generates 90 million unrecycled phones each year.", "qwen2.5:3b": "Finding new homes for old phones is beneficial both environmentally and socially. Research indicates that in developing nations, low-cost recycled handsets can help bridge the digital divide by enabling access to mobile communications among those who cannot afford newer models. In the UK, only 25% of retired mobile phones are returned for recycling, leaving a significant amount, estimated at 90 million units or about 9,000 tonnes of waste. This highlights the need to improve phone collection and reduce landfill usage. The report emphasizes that older phones can be reused in poorer nations where people cannot afford new models due to low wages. For example, in Romania, reconditioned mobiles are popular among pre-pay users who would otherwise struggle to get a mobile phone, given their economic situation. To promote this practice, consumers need to support companies committed to sending these devices overseas for reuse.", "opencoder:1.5b": "Finding new homes for old phones: Re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, but also has social benefits too.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe text is about reusing old mobile phones and how that helps both environmentally and socially. It mentions a forum study showing that many old phones end up in landfills because they're toxic. The user mentioned some statistics: 15 million phones go out of use each year, only 25% are recycled, leading to over 9 million handsets in the UK.\n\nThe report also talks about Romania being a popular place for reconditioned phones there due to fixed lines and social reasons. There are mentions of affordability issues in Romania because of low wages. The consumer group Georgeta Minciu is an example of someone who can afford a used phone but wants one anyway, which highlights the push for more affordable options.\n\nThe key points are: reusing old phones benefits environment and society; there's still a need to collect them instead of letting them rot; Romania has been a hotspot for reconditioned phones; affordability is an issue in poorer countries like Romania. The report suggests that phone operators and consumers should work together to make more mobiles available overseas, but the push for reconditioned ones might deter people from buying new ones.\n\nI need to capture all these points concisely without adding any extra information. So I'll start by introducing reusing old phones, mention the benefits, then talk about the statistics on UK usage and recycling rates. Then mention Romania as a case study, discuss affordability, and conclude with the push for reconditioned phones in poorer areas but also the need for new models to compete.\n\nI think that's all the main ideas without getting too technical or including extra details.\n</think>\n\nReusing old mobile phones benefits both environment and social benefits. Research shows old handsets can be reused in poorer nations, aiding the digital divide. The UK faces a problem where about 15 million phones are thrown away each year, with only 25% being recycled. This leads to over 9 million discarded phones reaching landfills, contributing to toxic waste. The report highlights that older phones have social and environmental uses in poorer areas like Romania. There's a push for reconditioned handsets there due to fixed lines, but affordability issues in Romania (low wages) hinder new models. consumers like Georgeta Minciu are willing to accept used ones as alternatives, pushing for more affordable options elsewhere.
