{"raw_text": "Millions to miss out on the net\n \n By 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.\n \n Around 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT. It compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is \"wishful thinking\", the report concludes.\n \n The study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.\n \n The gap between \"have-nets\" and \"have-nots\" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. \"Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,\" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. \"There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,\" said Mr Hosford.\n \n As now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.\n \n Those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. \"If we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,\" he said. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "The UK's population is projected to see a decline in internet access due to a lack of online education and job opportunities for those without it. \n\nBy 2025, around 40% of Britons will not have home internet access while approximately 27 million people are missing out on essential services such as education and medical information.\n\nDespite this, the gap between \"have-nets\" (those with internet access) and \"have-nots\" may narrow in some areas. \n\nThose most disadvantaged by the lack of online access include low-income families, older generations, and those with disabilities.\n\nThe digital divide is expected to worsen as more people become digitally literate but still lack essential services.", "llama3.2:3b": "40% of UK population will lack internet access at home by 2025\n23 million Britons will miss essential services due to no online access\nDigital divide will become more burdensome and obvious with time\nPsychological barrier remains as main obstacle to internet adoption\nLow-income families, older generation, and disabled groups most affected\nOrganisations must address the problem through community-specific initiatives", "gemma2:2b": "40% of the UK population will remain without home internet access by 2025.

Let me read through the text again carefully.\n\nFirst, it says that by 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still be without internet access at home. That seems like a big number. Then it mentions that BT, their telecoms company, predicts around 23 million Britons won't have online services compared to about 27 million who are already online. So the digital divide is expected to grow. The report concludes that this wishful thinking is not realistic because as people move online, they might also start using other devices, which BT says has reduced costs and improved coverage in remote areas. However, psychological barriers like lack of motivation or perceived benefits remain a problem.\n\nThe report also points out that the most disadvantaged groups are likely to be low-income families, older generations, and those with disabilities. For example, a quarter of digital have-nots might be low-income. The elderly would make up nearly a third by 2025. Companies like BT are mentioned as being part of the solution, especially with their Everybody Online project in Cornwall, where online training helped individuals transition to jobs.\n\nSo, I need to condense this into a summary that includes all these key points: 40% without net access in 2025, BT's prediction with improved coverage but still a digital divide barrier, issues for low-income families, the elderly, and older generations. Also, mention the focus on tackling the have-nots by addressing specific communities like Cornwall.\n\nI should make sure not to include any explanations or reasoning, just present the summary as plain text.\n</think>\n\nBy 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still lack internet access at home, according to a study.
