{"raw_text": "Santy worm makes unwelcome visit\n \n Thousands of website bulletin boards have been defaced by a virus that used Google to spread across the net.\n \n The Santy worm first appeared on 20 December and within 24 hours had successfully hit more than 40,000 websites. The malicious program exploits a vulnerability in the widely used phpBB software. Santy's spread has now been stopped after Google began blocking infected sites searching for new victims.\n \n The worm replaces chat forums with a webpage announcing that the site had been defaced by the malicious program. Soon after being infected, sites hit by the worm started randomly searching for other websites running the vulnerable phpBB software. Once Google started blocking these search queries the rate of infection tailed off sharply. A message sent to Finnish security firm F-Secure by Google's security team said: \"While a seven hour response for something like this is not outrageous, we think we can and should do better.\" \"We will be reviewing our procedures to improve our response time in the future to similar problems,\" the Google team said. Security firms estimate that about 1m websites run their discussion groups and forums with the open source phpBB program. The worst of the attack now seems to be over as a search conducted on the morning of the 22 December produced only 1,440 hits for sites showing the text used in the defacement message. People using the sites hit by Santy will not be affected by the worm. Santy is not the first malicious program to use Google to help it spread.

Let me read through the text first.\n\nThe main event is a virus called Santy that defaced many website boards by exploiting PHPBB software. It started on December 20, hit over 40k websites within 24 hours, then stopped when Google blocked them after starting to search for other sites running phpBB.\n\nI should mention the spread process and how Santy replaces forums with a message about a defaced site. Also, note that once blocked, the attack stopped. Then, there's information from Google about their response and some security firm estimates on website usage. Finally, compare Santy to MyDoom, which did similar things but didn't stop entirely.\n\nI need to make sure I cover all these points without adding extra details beyond what's in the text.\n</think>\n\nThousands of website forums were disrupted by a virus called Santy, exploiting PHPBB software. It first appeared on December 20 and quickly targeted over 40,000 websites within 24 hours. Once infected, sites started randomly searching for other phpBB users, causing Google to block their searches after defacing a site they were trying to access. A message from Google's security team suggested they would review their response protocols. Security firms estimated that about a million sites use phpBB for forums. After the attack, no significant website was affected by Santy.

With Google blocking new victims, the rate of infestations began to tail off in a seven-hour response, estimated at approximately 1 million websites running the open source phpBB program.

Santy is thought to be using an open-source software in its creation, causing chaos for both website owners and antivirus companies as it replaces chat forums with a message announcing that the site has been infected. Google has taken down millions of search queries directed at affected sites, which have reportedly been running the vulnerable phpBB software. This has led to a significant reduction in the rate of infectivity, suggesting that the problem might be over.\n\nDespite its efforts to improve its response time in similar situations, Google has been criticized for taking an \"us-versus-them\" approach, with security firms estimating that about 1 million websites run their discussion groups and forums with the open source phpBB program.
