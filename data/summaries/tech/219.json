{"raw_text": "Disney backs Sony DVD technology\n \n A next generation DVD technology backed by Sony has received a major boost.\n \n Film giant Disney says it will produce its future DVDs using Sony's Blu-ray Disc technology, but has not ruled out a rival format developed by Toshiba. The two competing DVD formats, Blu-ray developed by Sony and others, and Toshiba's HD-DVD, have been courting top film studios for several months. The next generation of DVDs promise very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. Both technologies use a blue laser to write information. It has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. Disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s Betamax versus VHS war. Sony lost out to JVC in that fight.\n \n The current battle for Hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. Last month, Paramount, Universal and Warner Brothers said they were opting for the Toshiba and NEC-backed format, HD-DVD high-definition discs.\n \n Those studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content. Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM Studios have already staked their allegiance with the Blu-ray Disc Association, whose members also include technology companies Dell, Samsung and Matsushita. Twentieth Century Fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content. Disney said its films would be available on the Blu-ray format when DVD players for the standard went on sale on North America and Japan, expected in 2006. Universal is to start producing films on the HD-DVD format in 2005, and Paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006.

Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe first paragraph mentions that Disney is backing Sony's Blu-ray Disc technology and hasn't ruled out a rival called HD-DVD from Toshiba. The competition has been ongoing for months, with several studios trying to switch formats. The main reason for this competition is high-definition content which promises better quality and more data storage. Both technologies use blue lasers but the shorter wavelength of Blue laser allows more data storage, which benefits content delivery.\n\nDisney was in a race against other big studios like JVC and others. They lost that fight by Sony to JVC, according to the text. The competition is crucial because high-definition films bring in significant revenue for studios, so they need a standard format to compete on.\n\nCurrently, 45% of DVD content comes from Blu-ray, while Toshiba's HD-DVD might have higher usage if it becomes popular. Paramount, Universal, and Twentieth Century Fox are starting production on the Toshiba formats, but it's uncertain when. If Disney chooses Blu-ray, their films would be available then. On the other hand, Universal is already going with HD-DVD starting in 2005.\n\nToshiba expects HD-DVD sales to reach $300 billion by 2010. The summary needs only the key points without any explanations or formatting.\n\nI should make sure to include Disney's backing for both formats, their current usage percentages, the competition's timing and results, the impact of high-definition on revenue, and the schedules for production on each format.\n\nLet me structure this into a concise summary that highlights these elements.\n</think>\n\nDisney is supporting both Sony's Blu-ray Disc technology and Toshiba's HD-DVD format in efforts to offer high-definition content. Currently, 45% of DVD content comes from Sony's Blu-ray discs, while Toshiba might have a higher usage. The competition was intense between 1980s Betamax versus VHS formats. Disney lost the bet to JVC, with JVC winning. High-definition films drive revenue, so studios need standardized formats like Blu-ray or HD-DVD. Currently, 47% of content is expected for Toshiba's format if it becomes popular.
