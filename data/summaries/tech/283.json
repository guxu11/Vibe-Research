{"raw_text": "Games help you 'learn and play'\n \n 'God games' in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational, says research.\n \n A US researcher has suggested that games such as The Sims could be a good way to teach languages. Ravi Purushotma believes that the world of The Sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods. The inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said Mr Purushotma.\n \n There must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework. But instead of fearing computer games, Ravi Purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games. \"One goal would be to break what I believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional,\" he said. He believes that the \"phenomenal ability\" of games such as The Sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation. The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. Boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be. \"The way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity,\" he said.\n \n By contrast, said Mr Purushotma, learning via something like The Sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. This was because The Sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players. Instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on. The incidental information about what a Sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said Mr Purushotma. By contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context. For instance, he said, in a version of The Sims adapted to teach German, if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word \"energie\" the actions of a tired Sim, stumbling then falling asleep, would illustrate the meaning. If necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players' or students' understanding.\n \n One of the drawbacks of The Sims, said Mr Purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation. However, online versions of The Sims, in which people have to move in, meet the neighbours and get to know the local town, could be adapted to help this. Although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, Mr Purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.\n \n Getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes. Before now, he said, educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games. But, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. This could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons. \"I'm hoping now to re-create a well-polished German learning mod for the sequel by this summer,\" he told the BBC News website. \"I'm encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with Japanese and Spanish.\" Earlier work with a colleague on using Civilisation III to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society's problems can not always come from making a single change. A report on the experiment said: \"Students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play, using geography and history as tools for their game, and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play.\" Mr Purushotma's ideas were aired in an article for the journal Language Learning and Technology.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Games such as The Sims can be used to teach languages due to their ability to capture the interest of adolescent audiences.

Game worlds are often described in foreign languages, which students may not understand, but this doesn't have to be the case.

However, it is important to remember that these games cannot replace the real world we live in, and their effectiveness will depend on the level of comprehension and persistence students have at the language level. \n\nThe game 'God games' has been gaining interest among educators due to its educational value. The concept behind the game involves having players control virtual people and societies, which can be a great source of inspiration for learners. Researchers have suggested that this could open up new opportunities for teaching languages, such as the Sims game in The Sims series.\n\nRavi Purushotma is a thought-provoking research on games. He believes that a significant part of learning languages, especially when it comes to a foreign country, can be achieved by playing these games \u2013 not just watching them, but also doing so. This could make language learning more accessible and effective, as learners don't have to spend hours trying to understand complex sentences or words.\n\nHowever, one downside is that the game may be difficult for students to master. The absence of spoken language could potentially hinder the understanding of a language, especially when it's a foreign language. \n\nIn terms of educational software titles, getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be incredibly powerful for learners. Teachers can use this as an opportunity to understand complex concepts with simple language, making language learning more accessible.\n\nOverall, while the games may not offer entirely new educational tools, they are a valuable tool that can help learners better understand languages and make more informed decisions.\n", "smollm:1.7b": "To summarize the text concisely:\n\n1.

Let me read through it carefully and make sure I understand each part.\n\nThe text starts with \"Games help you 'learn and play'.\" That's a bit of an abrupt statement but sets up the idea that using games can be educational and enjoyable.\n\nNext, there's a quote from a researcher named Ravi Purushotma. He suggests that games like The Sims could be useful for teaching languages, especially vocabulary and grammar. I remember he said that game fun might make learning less tedious. That seems key because it ties the use of games to reducing anxiety about language learning.\n\nThen there's more detailed information: he talks about how players in The Sims don't just get words; their actions and interactions with their world reveal meanings. So, the player isn't just listening to definitions but seeing consequences. That's a solid point for someone who might be concerned about traditional language lessons being boring.\n\nHe also mentions that many language lessons focus on rote memorization, which he compares to learning bike riding by only studying gravity. He says that games like The Sims have a better grasp of how language is used in real life. Maybe that's why they're effective because they show practical applications.\n\nPurushotma points out that while today's software isn't great for language learning compared to games, using game worlds like The Sims could make it easier by allowing teachers to adapt parts of the game for their lessons. This makes sense because you can customize content without needing extensive preparation.\n\nHe also brings up that using a simulated person in a game context, such as playing a simulation to learn German or others, could help with pronunciation. And he mentions that previous research showed games like Civilisation III could be useful for history learning by letting students play and reflect on history through gameplay.\n\nIn summary, Purushotma is advocating for the use of game-based education, particularly through apps like The Sims, to make language learning more engaging and effective. He's suggesting that games can provide real-world context, reduce stress, and offer varied learning experiences compared to traditional methods.\n</think>\n\nGames help you 'learn and play'  \nRavi Purushotma suggests using games, like The Sims, to teach languages because they reveal meanings through actions and interactions, making language learning more engaging.

By incorporating pre-made game worlds and easy-to-modify tools, educators can adapt parts of The Sims for their own lessons, enabling them to break the false assumption that learning and play are irrelevent. This could help break down the barrier of language learning and provide a more enjoyable way for students or parents to learn foreign langauges.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " A study conducted by Ravi Purushotma suggests that video games like The Sims can be a useful tool to teach languages. This is because, unlike traditional teaching methods, games offer an interactive experience that makes learning easier and more engaging. By emulating the behavior of virtual characters in a game environment, players can see for themselves what words mean and how they are used to build sentences. This approach not only promotes better understanding but also motivates learners to retain information by allowing them to interact with their world on multiple levels.\n\nIn a previous study involving Civilization III, a virtual historical simulation, Ravi Purushotma and his colleague discovered that playing Civilization III can help students realize that solving problems requires not just one change but rather making informed decisions based on the historical context. This understanding of how past actions can impact present situations is crucial for real-life problem-solving skills.\n\nBy using video games to teach languages, educationalists can avoid the false assumption that playing a game makes learning more enjoyable. Instead, they should embrace this new approach as a way to break down traditional barriers and make learning more engaging and effective. By incorporating elements of The Sims into their lessons, teachers can use pre-prepared game worlds to make it easier for them to adapt parts of the game to suit specific lesson plans or subjects. This will allow them to better target their teaching efforts and reach students in a more meaningful way.\n\nIn conclusion, while traditional teaching methods may struggle to keep pace with advances in technology, video games offer an exciting new approach to learning.
