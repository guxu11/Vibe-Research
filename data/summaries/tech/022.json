Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.\n \n The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said Sun's chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz. \"Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?\" he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California. The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil, gas and financial services industries.\n \n Some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said. Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says Sun offers processing by the hour. That means they charge users based on how much time they use their processing power. Cool.\n\nNext, Sun has launched a pay-as-you-go service called grid computing. They're marketing it as a new buzz phrase for a company that thinks computing capacity is as important as hardware and software. Interesting, so the main idea here is about the value of cloud computing infrastructure.\n\nSun Grid costs $1 per hour for an employee's processing power and storage on Sun-optimized systems. So if someone needs 50 hours of processing, it'll be $50. This is described as a \"grid computing service\" which they liken to electricity, emphasizing efficiency.\n\nThe chief operating officer, Jonathan Schwartz, says why build your own grid if you can get one for just a dollar an hour? That's the key point in his talk. He believes their model is cost-effective and transparent.\n\nSun will have to convince data center managers to switch from their current system but already has interest from industries like oil, gas, and finance. Some are willing to pay $12 per hour, which is a bit expensive, especially since they used 12 hours worth of power. But it's worth it for those customers.\n\nIn his demonstration, Sun showed servers processing data in a protein folding simulation. It took about a few seconds each, but the total cost was significant because it used up 12 hours. This experiment highlights the high upfront cost despite short runtime.\n\nSun Grid has an initial setup in existing buildings using idle servers to test software before shipping. IBM is a rival offering cheaper services. So Sun needs to position their service as cost-effective and efficient before competing with others.\n\nPutting this all together, the summary should capture the main points: pay-as-you-go processing, grid computing model linked to electricity (efficiency), pricing ($1 per hour), data centers wanting to switch models, interest from specific industries, successful demonstration of cost-effectiveness despite short runtime.\n</think>\n\nSun Grid offers a pay-as-you-go service for processing power and storage, akin to the development of utilities like electricity. Customers pay $1 per hour for services on Sun-optimized systems. Sun Grid, used by energy providers in states like California, aims to compete with IBM's-demanding model.
