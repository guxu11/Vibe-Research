{"raw_text": "Lifestyle 'governs mobile choice'\n \n Faster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests.\n \n Instead, phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company Ericsson. \"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. \"We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,\" he said. \"We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,\" he told the BBC News website.\n \n For the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. \"People's habits remain the same,\" said Dr Bjorn. \"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\"\n \n One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. Youngsters' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into different \"tribes\" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. \"For instance,\" he said, \"older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago.\" This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.\n \n Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.\n \n Once this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. \"Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,\" he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Phone firms should focus on consumer needs rather than just technology features when selling handsets, suggests research by Ericsson.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main point seems to be about how mobile phone tech isn't just about hardware; it's also about how people use their phones in different ways. The study by Ericsson suggests that consumers are more interested in their lifestyle than just the screen size or technology itself. They move their activities to their phone, which is convenient.\n\nThey interviewed 14,000 mobile owners and found that habits don't change the way they currently use their devices but instead switch it into using a phone for different purposes. For example, diary-writing among younger people benefits from a camera on their phone, making it more flexible.\n\nThe research also points out two main groups: \"pioneers\" who try new tech and \"materialists\" who follow trends. Pioneers are interested in trying things new and start innovations early, especially those that can be used widely, like cameras. Materialists use current tech to stay connected but don't jump to something entirely new.\n\nAnother key point is about the adoption speed: when at least 25% have new devices, consumers no longer worry about others seeing through their messages. Once this threshold is reached, new technologies tend to take off because they're tried and tested across different people.\n\nIn Japan, camera phones were initially seen as a failure but now are popular because many users capture moments daily. Similar trends are emerging in Europe too. People use cameras for special events or to document everyday life.\n\nSo I need to condense this into a summary without adding extra details beyond the main points: mobile tech isn't just about hardware; people's lifestyle usage varies based on what they have, and this affects how new devices take off.\n</think>\n\n Mobile phone technology isn't limited by its physical form. Consumers focus more on their daily use than screen size or device type. A study shows that mobility habits switch to using a phone for varied purposes, influenced by features like cameras. Pioneers and materialists drive tech adoption, with pioneers trying new trends, while materialists follow current innovations. Camera phones became popular in Japan after being seen as failures but are now frequent due to their flexibility. Similar trends emerge globally across Europe.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "The life style of mobile device users is changing due to the introduction of new technologies such as touchscreen, camera, voice recognition, and social network capabilities. Ericsson conducted an in-depth study showing how consumer behavior changes when adopting new features on their mobile phone. According to Dr Michael Bjorn, consumers are more likely to use smartphones for life style activities rather than merely using them for communication. Innovations like cameras on phones tend to gain traction as consumers become more interested in how they fit into their daily lives and as consumers change the way they use their phone. While some traditional consumer behavior remains, newer habits are emerging, with users starting to use new innovations in a different manner. In Europe, where camera technology is becoming increasingly popular, over 50% of people now take pictures with their phones every month, according to Dr Bjorn.", "tinydolphin:1.1b": " The study conducted by Ericsson indicates that consumers' habits in using their mobile phone are shifting from solely relying on the hardware capabilities to incorporating new features such as cameras, voice recognition, and gaming. This shift is attributed to factors like increased speed of change in technology and the influence of user groups like pioneers and materialists who tend to push themselves to try new things. According to Dr. Michael Bjorn, Senior Advisor on Mobile Media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab, the advent of advanced features has encouraged users to keep up with the latest trends in phone use. This trend is evident among younger generations, where pioneers and materialists are leading the charge when it comes to adopting new technologies. As such, these groups are pushing for more interactive experiences on their devices and are actively discouraged from using them solely for calls or text messaging.", "phi:2.7b": " In the article, Dr. Bjorn states that technology alone is not enough for phone firms to sell more handsets. Instead, they need to focus on how their products fit in with people's lifestyles. The study by Ericsson found that consumers continue to use their phones for activities like diary-writing and texting but do so in a different way using mobile phones. Dr. Bjorn suggests that as new technology is introduced, it gradually drives new habits and lifestyles. He also points out that the speed at which people buy handsets with new innovations on them affects the adoption rate of these innovations. Once 25% of users have handsets with new technologies, consumers are less concerned about potential security risks. Dr. Bjorn concludes that camera phones are becoming more popular as they offer a way to capture and share moments seamlessly in everyday life.\n", "orca-mini:3b": " Lifestyle 'governs mobile choice' as phone firms struggle to sell more handsets by focusing on technology alone.
