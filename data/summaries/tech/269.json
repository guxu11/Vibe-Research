{"raw_text": "Yahoo moves into desktop search\n \n Internet giant Yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e-mail and other files on their PCs.\n \n The firm is following in the footsteps of Microsoft, Google and Ask Jeeves, which have offered similar services. Search has become a lucrative and hotly-contested area of expansion for net firms, looking to extend loyalty beyond the web. With hard drives providing bigger storage, users could need more help to locate important files, such as photos.\n \n The desktop search technology has been licensed from a US-based firm X1 Technologies. It is designed to work alongside Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail programs. Searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important, especially as the amount of spam increases. According to research from message analysts the Radicati Group, up to 45% of businesses' critical information is stored in e-mail and attachments. Yahoo's software can also work separately on the desktop, searching for music, photos and other files. Users can search under a variety of criteria, including file name, size, date and time. It doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although Yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data. \"We are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content,\" said Julian Smith, an analyst with research firm Jupiter. \"It is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well,\" he said. Search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web. The new foray into desktop search has rung alarm bells for human rights groups, concerned about the implications to privacy. And not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services. Alexander Linden, vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm Gartner,downloaded the Google product but has since removed it. \"It was just not very interesting,\" he said. He believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals. \"Desktop search is just one of many features people would like but I'm suspicious of its usefulness,\" he said. More useful would be tools that can combine internet, intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching, he said.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Yahoo launches software for desktop search on PCs.\n\nThe service uses Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail programs as a base.\n\nIt allows users to search email effectively, especially with increasing spam and critical information stored in emails and attachments.\n\nThe technology can also search for music, photos, and other files.\n\nFuture versions will allow searching of web-based data as well.\n\nYahoo has licensed the technology from X1 Technologies.", "llama3.2:3b": "Yahoo launches software allowing users to search e-mail and files on PCs, licensed from X1 Technologies, working with Outlook and Express e-mail programs, offering search by file name, size, date and time.

The text starts by talking about Yahoo entering desktop search after Microsoft and Google did similar things. It mentions X1 Technologies licensing their system for this purpose. Then it explains that searching on PC is becoming more important as emails are more spammy and storage issues increase.\n\nThe example summary they provided mentions the new service targeting desktop users, incorporating e-mail, music, photos, etc., with a mention of Radicati Group's data and the fact that 45% of businesses have critical info in emails. It also talks about search engines being first ports but bringing privacy concerns if used improperly.\n\nI should note key points like Yahoo launching desktop search, licensing from X1, targeting desktop users, focusing on e-mail and other files, mention of 45% critical data, separate features for music and photos, promise future integration with web searches, concerns about privacy, and examples like Alexander's removal of Gartner's product.\n\nWait, the user said to only output the summary as plain text without explanations or formatting.

With 45% of businesses storing critical information in emails and attachments, this technology is seen as crucial for data management.
