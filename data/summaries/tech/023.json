{"raw_text": "Lasers help bridge network gaps\n \n An Indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country.\n \n Tata Teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network. The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections. In 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations.\n \n \"In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task,\" said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata. \"Heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult,\" he said. In some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. He said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. This has led Chennai-based Tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between Tata's core network and the premises of customers. The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. The hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses.\n \n The laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but Tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps. The lasers are also ideal for India because of its climate. \"It's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy,\" he said. In places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr Sridharan. \"Once we get the other permissions, normal time period for set up is a few hours,\" he said. By contrast, he said, digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. This speed of set up has helped Tata with its aggressive expansion plans. Just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities. But by the end of March the firm hopes to reach more than 1,000. \"Speed is very important because of the pace of competition,\" said Mr Sridharan.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Tata Teleservices uses lasers to bridge network gaps between customers' offices and its core network in India, enabling faster setup and higher speeds.

The laser technology can connect voice and data networks up to 4 kilometers away, with speeds approaching 1.25 gigabits per second (2000 times faster than broadband). Tata has also used the laser bridge in locations like Chennai, where permission for digging roads is difficult. Laser bridges are ideal due to favorable weather conditions, as rain rates are lower and fog is rare. This makes them more suitable for India's climate compared to traditional cable solutions. Setting up a laser bridge takes several hours or days, whereas laying new cables can take weeks.

Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe text starts by mentioning lasers helping bridge network gaps in India. Then, an Indian telecom company called Tata Teleservices is using lasers to set up their voice and data networks. They're setting up more than 700 locations in 12 months. The vice president said digging the ground for these laser bridges is difficult because of heavy traffic and underground layout.\n\nTata uses Lightpointe laser bridges, which can go up to 4km and connect both voice and data from premises to the core network. Their hardware runs at 1-2mbps but are much faster than broadband connections\u2014up to 20 times quicker.\n\nLaser bridges help because the firm needs more speed for their expansion plans. They set up faster, especially after getting necessary permissions which take a few hours once done. This has helped them grow quickly over time.\n\nSo, the key points I need to include are:\n1. Laser bridges replacing cables.\n2. Setting up 700 locations in 12 months.\n3. The firm's approach using Lightpointe bridges.\n4. Their hardware speed (up to 20x faster) compared to broadband.\n5. The difficulty of getting permission for laser setup, especially underground.\n6. Why lasers are better suited for India with their climate.\n7. Faster set-up time after permissions and the importance of speed in competitive markets.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all these points without being too verbose. Let me structure it step by step.\n</think>\n\nLasers have enabled Tata Teleservices in India to efficiently set up voice and data networks across 700 locations, with setup completed in just over a year. The firm uses Lightpointe laser bridges that connect premises to the core network at speeds up to 20 times faster than broadband.
