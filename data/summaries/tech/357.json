Hmm, let me read through what's given.\n\nThe first sentence says more than one million computers on the net were hijacked for attacks. That's a lot! It was revealed by security researchers who tracked hundreds of remote-controlled machines across various networks. The largest network had 50,000 computers that were hacked.\n\nI should note that these \"zombie\" networks are being monitored through something called Honeynet. They used software to log what the compromised machines did and report via IRC chat channels. These machines often had known but innocent functions because they were being recruited by hackers.\n\nThe researchers found that it took only a few minutes for a machine to be found, maybe even in seconds if caught easily. The main issue was that once a machine was compromised, it would report instructions from the hacker behind the tool. They exploited Windows vulnerabilities to take over machines. Also, home PC keyboards were used to launch viruses or spam campaigns.\n\nThey also saw various uses for these nets: spreading spam through relay networks, routing ads, abuse of Google's AdSense, controlling online polls/games, and targeting identity theft. There are 226 DDoS attacks on 99 targets by one firm, which is impressive. Others used them to manipulate AdSense and control online traffic.\n\nThe researchers concluded that with a few thousand bots, you can take down almost any network instantly. Even simple hands could spot these tools as powerful. This has wide-ranging applications beyond just hacking but also for security measures like spam filters.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: multiple million computers, use of zombie networks, tracking through Honeynet, exploitation of Windows, various uses in spreading and controlling, and effectiveness with few bots.\n</think>\n\nMore than one million computers on the net have been hijacked for attacks.
