Let me read through it carefully first.\n\nAlright, the text is about Nokia's new smart ticket system for buses. It mentions that mobiles can double up as travel cards and that they're planning a wireless ticket system on German buses. The system involves passing a phone over a smart-card reader which has already installed one. \n\nNokia said this will reduce queues and make traveling easier, especially in Hanau, near Frankfurt. They own a Nokia 3220 device with a special shell attached. Transport systems are using this method because it's smart and not dependent on paying for tickets, which is convenient.\n\nGerhard Romen from Nokia explained that the ticketless trial starts early next year and people can get information via phones. He mentioned using their mobile phone, maybe for getting product info or concert details, and even passing it over an advert of a rock star to find out concert information. \n\nHe also talked about how this could open up more possibilities for mobile devices interacting with everyday environments, like shopping or bus stops. He's confident the trial in Germany can be extended elsewhere because it offers access to many services and makes getting info easy.\n\nSo, I need to condense all this into a summary without adding any explanations or formatting. Just plain text. I'll start by mentioning that mobiles could double up as travel cards and mention the smart ticket system on German buses. Then, include Nokia's details about owning a special device with a shell, the system reducing queues, location in Hanau, and their market presence with Philips. Also, note the expansion potential beyond Germany and Romen's confidence.\n\nI should make sure I capture all key points: the system uses smart cards, the phone is passed over one, the device is Nokia 3220, special shell for security, reduced queues, Hanau location, transport info via phones, Philips partnership, and future expansion. \n\nLet me structure it concisely without any extra fluff.\n</think>\n\nMobiles could double up as travel cards with a smart ticket system on German buses, allowing travelers to pay by passing their phone over a reader installed on the vehicle. Nokia plans to sell a specially designed device, likely the Nokia 3220, that includes a unique shell for security. This system will reduce queues and enhance traveling, especially in Hanau, where it will be available starting early next year.

Transport systems around the world are transitioning from traditional tickets to smartcards, and Noki\u00e1 is taking advantage of this trend by testing a ticketless smartcard system on Hanau buses. The company has already developed a shell compatible with Hanau's existing ticketing system and plans to extend the trial to transport systems in other countries. The technology offers access to various services, such as getting information about upcoming concerts or bus schedules, making it easy for passengers to get the most out of their trips.
