Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst paragraph: US ticket sales are predicted to break records with over $9.4 billion, more than double last year's record of around $4.7 billion. They mention that overall figures might be lower because of a lack of a Christmas film like the previous year's Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings. Traditionally, 20% of annual sales are from the festive season, but this year it's about 18%, down to 25%. Average ticket prices went up significantly from $5.80 in 2002 to $6.25 in 2004.\n\nSecond paragraph: The biggest films like The Passion of Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios, which usually make key blockbusters. Sony Pictures is expected to take over second place with a billion-plus sales, more than doubling last year's $1.65 billion. Jeff Blake says they pulled off an \"unexpected\" hit like The Grudge.\n\nThird paragraph: Reviewing recent trends, Hollywood studios have been focusing on the upper and lower ends of the market instead of the middle. Warner Inc. is likely to end the year with around $1.25 billion in sales, while Disney stays third at about $2.8 billion. There's also mention of other studios like Blockbuster and Universal, but their shares are shrinking.\n\nPutting this together, I need to cover the record-breaking sales, the reasons behind them being lower than expected due to fewer Christmas hits and higher ticket prices, Sony's success as a major studio taking over second place, their surprise hit The Grudge, and how studios are shifting strategies. Also, mention the market share changes for other studios and the overall outlook.\n\nI should structure it so that each main point is clear without too much detail, just enough to cover all key points. Maybe start with US box office record-breaking, then move on to sales trends, Sony's performance, The Grudge example, and finally the competition among major studios.\n</think>\n\nUS box office ticket sales for 2004 were predicted to break records, hitting $9.4 billion, more than doubling last year's high of approximately $4.7 billion.

Sony Pictures, known for major blockbusters, expected second place with sales exceeding $1 billion, more than doubling last year's $1.65 billion.\n\nWarner Inc. likely ended the year in second place with around $1.25 billion, while Disney stayed third at approximately $2.8 billion.
