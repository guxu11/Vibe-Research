Let me read through the content again to understand the key points.\n\nSo, first, there's a conflict between Hendrix supporters and some local authorities over a house in Seattle called the Hendrix Foundation. The house is a run-down old place for Al Hendrix and his family. They've been moved before, but now they're asking the city to move it again because of a new plan.\n\nThe city wants the building to be moved by February 22nd, and they want the mayor and others to have the authority to do so without destroying the house. But someone mentioned that the mayor is going to claim his office because he destroyed the house, which might make it harder for the city.\n\nHendrix himself, named Ray Rae Marshall, stated that this was a temporary situation and didn't threaten the property. Instead, he asked the authorities to move the building so Hendrix can have his museum. The family wants it named after him.\n\nNow, someone suggested paying for the house to be moved by Janie Hendrix, their stepsister. She's hoping to see a road named after her father and that she doesn't have to fight everything to get the honor.\n\nHendrix was a huge figure in music, died in 1970 at 27 from overdose. The proposals are causing some tension with his family, so they're trying to turn the house into a museum or memorial.\n\nI need to make sure I include all these points: the conflict between Hendrix supporters and the city, the reasons for moving the building (the new development plan in 2002, moving it now), the mayor's statement about destroying the property, the family's desire for the museum named after their father, the idea of a payment to move the house, and Hendrix's legacy as one of the greatest guitarists.\n\nI also need to note that the city hasn't offered any deal yet. The proposal is still pending approval from the authorities.\n</think>\n\nThe conflict between Jimi Hendrix supporters and Seattle officials over Al Hendrix's run-down home in Seattle has been ongoing. The house, built in 1953-1956 by Al Hendrix and his family, was moved to another site once before. The city of Seattle is now requesting the move to a new development location for development purposes with a deadline set for moving on February 22nd. The mayor's office is concerned that the move would require destruction of the property, but instead, they are asking the authority to allow the house to be moved without immediate demolition.\n\nHendrix himself, Ray Rae Marshall, emphasized that this was a temporary situation and did not threaten the property. He expressed hope for the city to move it so Hendrix can have his museum. The family, led by their stepsister Janie Hendrix, seek the honor of naming the road after their father, reflecting his importance in music.\n\nHendrix, known as one of the greatest guitarists, died in 1970 from an overdose.
