Let me read through it carefully and see what key points are being made.\n\nFirst, the woman behind \"Mamma Mia!\" is Joss Stone. She's a British young singer at number one on the music millionaires list with \u00a35m. She was brought in by Judy Craymer, who has a big income of \u00a367m. Judy set up Mamma Mia! with Catherine Johnson and members of Abba, so that's another important point.\n\nClive Calder is also on the list but at number 31, with a huge \u00a31.3m income. He used to be a record label boss who sold his label Zomba to BMG for \u00a380m. He was in acts like Britney Spears, and he made millions before.\n\nThen there are other big names: Andrew Lloyd-Webber got \u00a3700m last year, Michael Jackson with \u00a3439m, David Beamoc with \u00a3252m, and Sir Cameron Mackintosh also at \u00a3400m. These people have had huge financial breakthroughs.\n\nPop idol Simon Fuller's situation is a bit tricky because he lost his wealth from selling 19, which was a loss for him. Joss Stone came in to make up for that with her \u00a35m. She's the first on the young millionaires list with a 17-year-old singer.\n\nThe Beckhams, who include the daughter of George Harrison, made another big move. They had an inheritance from the late Beatle and are now at number two with \u00a375m. But they still aren't at the top like the others.\n\nSo putting it all together, the text talks about several new big names in music who've gained significant wealth, some bringing their millionaires lists to number one or two, while others have made headlines but haven't surpassed the others yet.\n</think>\n\nJoss Stone, a British young soul singer, joins a list of young millionaires with \u00a35m. Judy Craymer, whose band \"Abba\" inspired her hit song, has \u00a367m. Clive Calder, former record label boss, has \u00a31.3m. The Beckhams inherited \u00a3140m and are second at \u00a375m.
