{"raw_text": "TV show unites Angolan families\n \n Angolan families who are attempting to track each other down, after being separated by nearly 30 years of war, are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular TV show.\n \n Meeting Point has become one of TV Angola's most watched programmes, and has reunited hundreds of families. It runs daily, not only on the television but also on the radio. Every Friday, hundreds of people gather in Luanda's Independence Square to record a message in front of the TV cameras, in the hope that a lost relative will see it. Many relatives have been reunited on air. \"At the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge, huge crowds,\" Sergio Gera, the programme's chief co-ordinator, told BBC World Service's Assignment programme. \"Now things are a little calmer, there are slightly less people - but, after two and a half years of broadcasting, there are still a lot of people going.\"\n \n The media in the southern African country, twice the size of France, has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives. Hundreds of thousands of people died in Angola's 30-year civil war, which finally ended in 2002, and tens of thousands of people are still missing. Many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all, 90% of Angolan families have lost someone.\n \n The idea of recording in Independence Square was modelled on a square in the Argentine capital Buenos Aries, where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing, and to exchange news. One woman, Victoria Lapete, found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in Independence Square live on Meeting Point. She had not seen her sibling for 28 years. \"When we saw each other, we threw ourselves into each other's arms,\" she told Assignment. \"We started to cry. I felt very, very happy, because I'd spent so long without any family. Suddenly I had a sister again.\" However, Angola is one of the poorest countries in Africa, and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few. This means that elsewhere in the country, the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In the city of Wambo, the ICRC runs the Gazetta - a 200-page, tabloid-size book which contains 13,000 names of missing or displaced.\n \n Their task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country. \"It's very difficult - there are many displaced,\" stated Joaquim Sahundi, head of tracing in Wambo.\n \n \"As they try to go back [home], others are trying to relocate their relatives. Many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages, in the bush, there has been no clearance of mines. \"When people are crossing these areas, they step on mines.\" The ICRC also uses the media where it can, running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on Radio Angola. Meanwhile, there remain massive challenges to Angolan families even once they are reunited. \"The programme of family reunification is extremely important, but for these families to remain reunified, there has to be social integration, job access, education, healthcare,\" said Rafael Marques of the pro-democracy George Soros Foundation for Southern Africa. \"Essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction - that's why it has been persistently calling for a donor's conference. That is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Angolan families who were separated by nearly 30 years of war are coming together through TV show \"Meeting Point\" which reunites hundreds with lost relatives, in Independence Square in Luanda where people record messages to increase the chances of being seen. \n\nThe program has brought attention to Angola's high number of missing persons and deaths in its civil war (1990-2002), with 90% of families reported as having a member missing.

Let me read through the text again to make sure I understand all the key points.\n\nThe first sentence mentions that TV shows are making it easier for families who've been separated by nearly 30 years because of conflict. The show, Meeting Point, has brought together hundreds of families and even more people on camera each week in Luanda. It's both seen on TV and radio, which is interesting.\n\nThen, the text talks about Angola being a small country with half the size of France, but they're in a prolonged civil war. A lot of families lost relatives, and now many are missing, especially since 2002 when the conflict ended. Only 90% of families have someone alive\u2014so it's still a big challenge.\n\nThe show was inspired by a program in Argentina where mothers talked to dead people about their families. In Angola, Victoria Lapete found her sister in Independence Square live on Meeting Point, but she hadn't seen her for 28 years. That moment made the family feel hopeful and connected.\n\nHowever, Angola has limited access to TV or radio, so reuniting families there mostly depends on organizations like the Red Cross in Wambo, who run a tabloid-sized magazine with a lot of information. But the families still face other challenges, like lots of landmines, which can cause serious harm when people move through areas.\n\nThere's also mention of how families need social integration, education, and healthcare for them to stay together after reunification. The government seems focused on getting international donors instead because that's their political goal.\n\nAlright, so I need to condense this into a concise summary without any extra information or explanations. Let me list the main points:\n\n1. Meeting Point is a TV show that brings families back.\n2. It was inspired by a program in Argentina where mothers shared stories.\n3. The show ran daily and also on radio.\n4. Many families are missing, especially Angolan families, due to conflict.\n5. There's a big issue of landmines disrupting relocation efforts.\n6. The show has hopeful moments like Victoria Lapete finding her sister.\n7. The government is struggling with reuniting families despite the show's help.\n\nI need to make sure each of these points is included but in a simplified way without losing any important details.\n</think>\n\nMeeting Point, a TV program in Angola, aims to bring together families separated by nearly 30 years due to conflict. Inspired by a program on Argentine mothers sharing stories, it features daily updates and is also available on radio. Many Angolan families lost relatives during the civil war, with tens of thousands still missing. A pivotal moment was Victoria Lapete finding her sister in Independence Square live on the show, though she had not seen her for 28 years.
