So the summary should mention that Prince was crowned as the top music earner for that year.\n\nThen, they mentioned he earned more than any other pop star back then. The text goes on to say Madonna and Elton John were in second place with their earnings mentioned at $54.9m and $29.5m respectively. Wait, no, actually, the next part says Madonna was in second with $54.9m and Garfunkel in 10th with $24.9m. But then it clarifies that Madonna still led because of production costs.\n\nNext point: The tour sales for Prince were $56.5 million from concerts, albums, and publishing. Simon and Garfunkel were third place but earned $24.9m through their tours. Simon and Garfunkel also had a solo record, so they probably have more than just the album earnings.\n\nMadonna's tour was a big success, earning $30.4 million in 2005 (the next year) because her tour took $90.3m in ticket sales. But she still led at second place because of tour expenses and press releases.\n\nMetallica had their tour also in 2004, earning $43.1m ($23.1m at the time). They were third but led by an album that earned them $19m. Metallica's tour included a show on Las Vegas Strip where they played 50 Cent's 5th concert, which contributed $24m.\n\nOther performers like Rod Stewart had high earnings from sold-out shows and their song collections. 50 Cent was at the top with $24m but 19th place overall due to lower sales elsewhere.\n\nSo putting this all together, I need to make sure each key point is included concisely.
