She played various roles including a hard-done wife or employee.\n\nIn recent years, she appeared on BBC shows like The Cazalets and in the London stage version of Beauty and the Beast.

Including that she had one son, Alan, adds to her legacy.\n\nI need to keep each point clear and concise without adding extra information beyond what's provided in the original text. The summary should flow logically from introducing Patsy Rowlands, her career highlights, personal background, personality traits, professional achievements, and her legacy with family details.\n\nLet me structure it:\n\n1.
