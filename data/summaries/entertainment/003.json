The user provided a detailed excerpt, and they want me to make a concise summary that only contains the key ideas and details without any explanations or formatting.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the original text carefully. It talks about two things: one is about turning a classic film into a musical for a show called \"The Opera\" based on the controversial show by producer Jon Thoday. The other part mentions that Frank Capra's movie was turned into a \u00a37 million musical with Steve Brown, who wrote a winning play called Spend Spend Spend.\n\nI notice that both involve Frank Capra and Jon Thoday working together. They're using the same name for the film but different names for the project\u2014It's A Wonderful Life for the movie and The Opera for the show. The production is in London, and they've held workshops, with a cast opening for investors.\n\nI should make sure to include key points: the transformation from a movie to a musical, the names involved, the budget, the collaboration between Capra and Thoday, and some about the film itself by Philip van Doren. It's important to mention that Thoday bought the rights in 1999 after Brown's success.\n\nI also need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main transformations\u2014changing the title from a movie to a show, the collaborative effort between Capra and Thoday, the budget of \u00a37 million, the collaboration with Spend Spend Spend for the play, and the financial aspect of the project.\n\nPutting it all together, I can structure the summary by first stating that the film is being turned into a musical under Jon Thoday's banner. Then mention the key details about Frank Capra and the collaboration. Include where they're taking place in London, the workshops held, the cast revealing the show to investors, and the reasons behind the project\u2014financial success of Spend Spend Spend and the legacy of The Greatest Gift.\n\nI need to make sure that all these points are covered without adding any extra information or explanations beyond what's provided.

Frank Capra's 1946 movie was bought rights from Philip van Doren Stern in 1999, allowing Paramount to use its title under the new project.
