Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says that comedian Chris Morris is returning for a new sitcom. He's known as the creator of \"Brass Eye,\" which is a controversial TV show about a mayor who goes crazy and gets into hotels, leading to funny situations. So, Morris is bringing back that series but in a different format\u2014probably a sitcom.\n\nNext, it mentions that he will direct and co-write Nathan Barley, a character from \"Tv Go Home.\" I know that \"Tv Go Home\" is a cult website where people host funny videos. The new sitcom will be a satire of the London media scene, with Nicholas Burns as the title role. It was mentioned that it satirizes the handling of paedophilia issues, which led to 2,500 complaints in 2001.\n\nThen, there's some information about Charlie Brooker, who created \"Tv Go Home\" and co-wrote the series. He described Nathan Barley as a character-driven comedy that blends webmaster, guerrilla film-maker, screenwriter, DJ, and a self-facilitating media node. The show will also feature Dan Ashcroft and Claire, who is a style magazine columnist but has a dislike for \"cool\" scenes and prefers sketch comedy instead.\n\nMorris was behind another satirical news show satire called \"The Day Today,\" and there's also a dark sketch comedy series called \"Jam.\" So the new sitcom is blending these different styles\u2014 TV Go Home satire, sketch comedy, and maybe some other elements.\n\nIt also mentions that the new series will start in February. The main goal here seems to be to show how Morris is reimagining the media scene from a comedic perspective, combining internet humor with real-life issues like paedophilia and sketch comedy.\n\nSo putting this all together, I should create a concise summary highlighting the key elements: Morris returns for a sitcom, it's a parody of London media, featuring Nathan Barley as a character, with themes of saturation, sex, and sketch comedy. It's set in February, bringing back \"Brass Eye\" on another medium.\n</think>\n\nComedian Chris Morris is returning to bring a satirical take on the London media scene to TV4.
