Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe text is about a US composer recreating a Bach score that was lost. The composition is from 1728 and specifically called Wedding Cantata BWV 216. It was found in Japan by Japanese pianist Chieko Hara, who died in 2001 at 86. The work was missing for over 80 years. Joshua Rifkin, a composer and interpreter of Bach, is recreating it.\n\nHe mentioned wanting to keep the lost piece for future generations. He said he first wanted the fragment to stay put but then thought about using paleontologists to reconstruct it from a bone. So, he's taking parts of the score he found in Germany and translating them into German vocal music for soprano and alto, with seven movements between 20-25 minutes each. The instrumental parts were mostly lost except for two: a duet and aria.\n\nRifkin described this challenge as like solving a Rubik's cube but focused on the melody instead of pieces.

This work was found among Japanese papers of Japanese pianist Chieko Hara, who died in 2001 at 86 years old. The piece had been missing for over 80 years when discovered. Joshua Rifkin, a composer and interpreter of Bach, recreated the lost music. He initially wanted to keep the fragment for future generations but then thought about using paleontologists to reconstruct it from a bone. The result was seven vocal movements lasting between 20-25 minutes each, with two lost instrumental parts (duet and aria) that were previously used elsewhere in Bach's work.
