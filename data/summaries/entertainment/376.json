Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe first paragraph mentions that French readers are bracing for a new Da Vinci novel by the author of \"The Da Vinci Code.\" That's interesting because Da Vinci is a famous artist and he wrote another book, so it might be connected somehow.\n\nNext, there's an article about Dan Brown's new novel called \"Angels and Demons,\" which will be sold in France. It mentions that the novel was translated into more than 40 languages since its release in 2003, which is a big deal for international readers. The book is set in Paris, including the Louvre museum, which is the headquarters of the French Academy of Sciences and one of the oldest art museums.\n\nThe article also notes that \"Angels and Demons\" deals with moral issues like religion vs. science and delves into the mysteries around the Pope. Brown wrote something about Vatican closures he didn't even know existed. That's a significant point because it highlights the book's speculative nature.\n\nThen there are some details about the movie version of \"Angels and Demons,\" directed by Ron Howard, starting in May at the Paris museum with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou as stars. The film includes parts shot inside the Louvre, so that might be a cool feature for viewers who want to see the setting live.\n\nPutting this all together, I need to make sure I capture the main points without adding extra details. So the summary should mention the new Da Vinci novel in France, introduce Dan Brown's book on sale there, talk about the translation success and cultural impact, highlight the themes of religion and science, and include information about the movie and its release location.\n\nI should keep it clear and concise, making sure each key element is included: the new book by Da Vinci, Dan Brown's book being sold in France, the translation success, the themes of the book, the movie details, and where it will be shot. Also, I need to avoid any unnecessary fluff or explanations.\n</think>\n\nThe French are gearing up for a new Da Vinci novel by the author of *The Da Vinci Code*.
