Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence mentions that Sir Elton John has performed at a special concert in Paris to raise money. That's the main action here. Then he plays 2,700 people on Sunday at the French capital's Bastille opera house. The crowd is big, so that's a key detail about the size of the audience.\n\nHe talks about how he used hits from his back catalogue, which makes sense because Elton John is known for those tracks. The concert was part of an effort to bring more events to that venue, aiming to help children in Sri Lanka after the tsunami. The money will go to a foundation called fondation pour l'Enfance.\n\nHe also mentioned the crowd, including a former French president and his wife, Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Anne-Aymone. These people are all part of the event, which adds credibility. He explained that for most years he went through drugs and alcohol, but for the last 14 years he was normal. The song he sang is \"David\" with reference to his partner David Furnish.\n\nAdditionally, there's mention of another singer, Phil Collins, who they teamed up with to record a version of Eric Clapton's tears in heaven. They plan to release that record but haven't set a date yet.\n\nSo the key points are: Elton John gave a powerful performance at Paris opera house, sold out, raised money for children in Sri Lanka, had a controversial past with substance abuse, performed with other artists, and plans to do more events there.\n\nI need to condense all that into a concise summary without adding anything else.
