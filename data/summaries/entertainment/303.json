{"raw_text": "Film production 'falls' 40% in UK\n \n The number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law among those affected, Screen Daily has said.\n \n Twenty-seven British films were made in the UK last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. It attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the National Lottery. UK and US co-productions in Britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.\n \n Last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK. Several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and Miramax Films. Shooting on period drama Tulip Fever, which was to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley, was postponed indefinitely while shooting of The Libertine starring Johnny Depp was moved to the Isle of Man.\n \n \"There isn't anything coming in to replace (the funds),\" said The Libertine's executive producer Marc Samuelson. \"We are in a hiatus.\" Films with \"medium\" budgets of up to \u00a39m, a similar level to box office hits Vera Drake, Calendar Girls and Enduring Love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added. Big budget co-productions, such as the Harry Potter series, continued to be shot in the UK, however. The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK.\n \n \"The drop was expected as there was no way 2003's record level of production could be bettered,\" the council's spokesperson said. \"The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.\" It was \"too early\" to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said. In September the government introduced subsidies worth up to \u00a34m per film for medium budget films, under new Treasury measures.

Let me read through all the details provided.\n\nFirst, the main point is that the British film industry fell by 40% in 2004. They're talking about specific films affected, like Johnny Depp and Jude Law's work.\n\nThen, there are stats on how funding changed. The number of films went from 45 to 27 last year, which is a big drop, attributed partly to tax cuts and reduced funding.\n\nNext, co-productions in Britain dropped too, going from 102 to 81. So, some projects were cut short because of the clampdown on tax loopholes and funding reductions.\n\nMarc Samuelson from The Libertine is quoted saying there's no replacement for their funds and they're in a hiatus with Tulip Fever. Also, US films shot in the UK saw a drop due to weaker pound against dollar, so lower U.S. film counts were expected.\n\nThe UK Film Council mentioned that 2003 was a good year for British production, especially films like Bridget Jones' movie and others filmed entirely in the UK. The trend towards co-production has been maintained but now with other countries involved.\n\nThey expect the downward trend to continue into 2005 unless something changes. The new government introduced subsidies for medium budget films, starting from September 2004, which might help but they won't replace the previous tax relief system.\n\nNow, putting this all together, I need to make sure to highlight the main trends without getting too detailed.
