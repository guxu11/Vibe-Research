So, the user has provided a text about an art-themed postcard sale, including some key details like the artists involved, the price, when it's happening, who was there, and the funds raised. They want a summary that captures the main points without any extra info.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The user wants only the summary in plain text, no explanations or formatting. So my task is to condense the given paragraph into a concise version that includes all essential information.\n\nI'll start by identifying the key elements from the original text: the artists, the price of postcards, when the sale opened and closed, who attended early, what Sue Bradburn said about big names, the funds raised, the viewing history, roles of specific directors and contributors, and the significance of the 11th year.\n\nNext, I need to condense each of these points into one or two sentences. For example, instead of mentioning all the artists, just noting that some are students/graduates from RCOA or other institutions. Similarly, when talking about the queues at the start, mention that it's now gone but had a big crowd early on.\n\nI should make sure to include Sue Bradburn's statement about big names and how visitors studied each work. Also, highlight the funds raised for the Student Award Fund and the 11th year significance.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to ensure that everything is covered succinctly without any unnecessary details. It should flow well and retain the essence of the original text.\n</think>\n\nArtists' secret postcards on sale  \nPostcards by artists including Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin have sold just hours after the Royal Academy of Arts annual Secrets Sale opened.  \nAll postcards are priced at \u00a335, with tickets ranging from 8am Friday to 6pm Saturday.  \nSue Bradburn, RCA's spokeswoman, said \"there are still some big names left, such as Mario Testino,\" and visitors would have studied each work to find the signature on the back.  \nThe exhibition has been open for viewing since November 19, with film director Ken Loach, fashion designer Hussein Chalayan, and former Blur guitarist Graham Coxon designing postcards for the sale.  \nSome contributing artists are students or recent graduates of RCOA or other leading art colleges, raising funds for the Fine Art Student Award Fund.  \nKnown as \"The Famous Sale,\" it is now its 11th year, showcasing works by prominent and rising artists.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "The Royal Academy of Arts has sold just a few hours after opening their Secret Sale, featuring postcards by artists including Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin.
