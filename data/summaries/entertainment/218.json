They had to pull it out in New York and Pennsylvania after two weeks, though he expected it back on January 3rd.\n\nStern announced moving his career to a new satellite service next year. He left conventional radio where he used to be. Before that, four stations owned by Clear Channel dropped him because of issues with the FCC's regulations.\n\nClear Channel and Viacom both faced big fines for violating the FCC.
