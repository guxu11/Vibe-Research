Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst sentence: \"U2 have smashed Irish box office records with ticket sales...\" That seems like the main point. They've sold over 150,000 tickets in 50 minutes. Got that.\n\nNext part: \"Tickets for the two concerts at the city's Croke Park stadium were released...\" So they're selling tickets online and not in physical stores on Friday morning? That makes sense because often tickets are released online first, especially if it's a major event.\n\nThen there's Justin Green saying, \"Nothing like it has ever been seen in Ireland before,\" and he estimates million tickets. He also mentions the tour starts in San Diego on March 28th, covering 13 US cities and ending in Lisbon in August. That's pretty extensive, so that's key info.\n\nMr. Green said ticket outlets were \"bombarded\" by fans because there are thousands disappointed all over the country. They wanted people first in line at Ticketmaster on St Stephen's Green, which is their shopping center. But most tickets sold online, priced between 59.50 and 80 euros each.\n\nEarlier this week, Bono announced they'll play two shows at Croke Park with record demand. This adds to the excitement since U2 has already been big.\n\nSo I need to make a concise summary that includes these key points: their ticket sales, the dates of their tour, Bono's announcement about playing both shows, and how it stands out because they've sold many tickets quickly.\n\nI should avoid any extra information and focus on the main highlights. Make sure it's plain text without explanations or formatting.\n</think>\n\nU2 has sold over 150,000 tickets for their two concert dates in Ireland within 50 minutes, breaking Irish box office records.
