Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the important points.\n\nThe text starts by introducing Moreno's debut, where she makes Oscar Mark, which suggests a new role in an Oscar-winning film. Then it mentions that she's joining a rare group of actresses nominated for an Oscar for a foreign language film. That's interesting because the group seems to be focused on minor roles or perhaps multiple projects.\n\nThe previous director, Joshua Marston, was looking for a star to play Maria Full of Grace in a foreign language movie. He wanted someone who could handle a minor role like a drug mule with a condom. Moreno is the last hope for him because she's 23 and has been trying since college started. She's already received nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards and previous film festivals, but these are separate awards.\n\nHer past work was in Bogota, using Ruben Di Pietro's theater school. She's now at the Berlin Film Festival where her performance didn't win an Oscar, so they tied it with Theron's winning film there. This makes Moreno look like one of the most promising actresses around. Her next project is a Spanish script aimed at Pedro Almodovar or Alejandro Amenabar.\n\nI need to capture all this without too much detail. So the summary should mention Moreno's debut and her role, her previous projects in Bogota, the director's situation, her nominations, the Berlin Festival tie, and her current projects.\n\nI think I covered everything: her name, what she did in the movie, the director, her previous work, her nominations, the festival, and her next project. That should be a solid summary.\n</think>\n\nSummarized text:\n Moreno joined a group of actresses nominated for an Oscar for a foreign language film. She made Oscar Mark, playing a minor role in a Maria Full of Grace film with director Joshua Marston, who sought a minor character. Moreno is the last hope due to her age and previous projects in Bogota under Ruben Di Pietro.
