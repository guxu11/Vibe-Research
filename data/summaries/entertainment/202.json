The MPs are urging the National Audit Office (NAO) to take on a \"free hand\" when investigating spending. This makes sense because the NAO typically handles financial oversight, so having more autonomy could improve accountability.\n\nThere's also mention of a report into the BBC's operations. It says that while Freeview has had some success since ITV Digital was shut down in 2002, there are still challenges like coverage gaps. The government is considering switching from analogue TV to digital services, which would be beneficial for subscribers.\n\nThe NAO's role here is to monitor how the licence fee money is used.
