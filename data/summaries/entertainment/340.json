Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the main points are that De Niro completed a box office double by topping both the UK and US charts at the same time with two films. The first film was \"Meet the Fockers,\" which he stars in, and it topped the UK chart. It's a comedy sequel with Ben Stiller, Hoffman, and Streisand. It took \u00a37.2 million in three days, which is eight times more than the second film, \"Closer.\" In terms of US box office, \"Assault on Precinct 13\" was third, but they were impressive with \u00a3750,000 in its first weekend.\n\nThen, he made a new thriller called \"Hide and Seek,\" which was a supernatural horror. It's set in a scenario where a widower whose daughter has an imaginary friend turns nasty. The UK chart showed \"Meet the Fockers\" pushed \"Closer\" down, but surprisingly, \"Creep,\" another film, also did well. In the US, it didn't do as well and only got \u00a3140,000.\n\nLooking at the Oscar nominations, De Niro's films didn't seem to affect audience choices much. The leading contenders like The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby, and Ray dropped significantly. I should make sure to mention his role in \"Hide and Seek\" as a pivotal moment because it changed everything, even though box office performance wasn't the only factor.\n\nI need to keep it concise, just the summary without explanations or formatting. No markdown or anything else.
