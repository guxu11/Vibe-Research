{"raw_text": "US actor 'found with gun residue'\n \n Actor Robert Blake had gunshot residue on his hands and clothes the night his wife was shot dead, a court has heard.\n \n But it may not have come from the shot that killed Bonny Lee Bakley in 2001, Mr Blake's murder trial was told by criminalist Steven Dowell. Mr Dowell told a Los Angeles court the residue may have come from Mr Blake's revolver, his gun collection, his presence at the crime scene or police. The 71-year-old former star of US TV drama Baretta has denied murder. Mr Blake said he found Ms Bakley, 44, dead in a car after they left a restaurant.\n \n He said he briefly returned to the restaurant to collect a gun he had left behind and discovered her body when he returned. The gun he collected was not the murder weapon. It could also have been picked up if he touched or leant on the car when he found the body, or from a police box in which his clothes were later stored. The box had come from an area where officers went after being on the firing range. But Mr Dowell also said the residue would have been present if Mr Blake fired a gun that night. Witnesses have already told the trial Mr Blake \"stood out as being quite nervous and agitated\" at the restaurant before the murder.

Let's see... \n\nFirst, the main characters are Robert Blake and Bonny Lee Bakley. I remember Blake was an actor who starved for a TV show called Baretta. He had some gun residue near his body when she died, but the exact source isn't clear because there could be multiple possibilities. The court is hearing about this.\n\nSteven Dowell, a criminalist, testified about it saying that the residue might come from Blake's revolver, his collection, or where he was when he found the body. He mentioned it could also be picked up if he touched the car, so maybe another person's property. Plus, there was a box in his clothes that he stored, and Dowell said even if he fired a gun that night, the residue might still be there.\n\nBlake denied murder and stated he found Bakley in a car after the dinner but only returned to collect a gun he had left behind. That gun wasn't the murder weapon. He could have gotten it elsewhere too. Witnesses at the scene described Blake as nervous and angry, so maybe that played a role in his testimony.\n\nThe trial is facing possible life in prison if he's convicted because of this DNA evidence linking him to Bakley.
