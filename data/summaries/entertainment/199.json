{"raw_text": "&#163;1.8m indecency fine for Viacom\n \n Media giant Viacom has paid out $3.5m (\u00a31.8m) to end investigations into indecency in its US radio and TV shows.\n \n The settlement to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ends a long-running saga dating back to 2001. The FCC was looking into 50 shows, including those by \"shock jock\" Howard Stern and two New York DJs. Stern recently announced he was leaving Viacom while the two DJs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church. After the church incident two years ago Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.\n \n It also agreed to train its broadcasters and employees about indecency laws. The agreement cancels investigations into about 50 radio and television shows, said Richard Diamond, FCC deputy secretary of communications. The shows were broadcast by Viacom-owned stations across the United States. Viacom has five days to pay the $3.5m fine, according to the agreement.

First, I'll read through it carefully to understand all the key points.\n\nThe text starts with a paragraph about the $3.5 million fine for Viacom, explaining how they paid out for investigations into radio and TV shows. It mentions that the settlement was with the FCC from 2001, involving shows like \"Shock Jock\" Howard Stern's and two New York DJs. The show featuring the church incident had their staff laid off after a shocking event in 2020. Viacom agreed to install audio equipment at their stations and train employees about indecency laws. This ended investigations into 50 shows, which is less than what the FCC was looking into.\n\nThen it shifts to Richard Diamond from the FCC, who mentioned that the settlement will cancel investigations into 50 radio and TV shows by Viacom, though there might be more shows in the future. The agreement cancels about 50 shows but not all; some may still need investigation. The fine for this was $3.5 million, due in five days.\n\nViacom has a history with fines: it paid out $1.7 million to settle an FCC violation involving Howard Stern's show, and that's from 1995. It also paid more recently, but the details aren't mentioned here.\n\nViacom is challenging the 2001 FCC fine, arguing it was unfair. They're contesting the $550,000 fine they were supposed to pay. I'm not sure if that's accurate because sometimes settlements can involve multiple parties or the same party for different amounts.\n\nIn conclusion, Viacom is still in breach of their agreement with the FCC and needs to pay more, but there are ongoing investigations.\n</think>\n\nViacom Inc., a major media giant, has paid $3.5 million to settle violations related to indecency issues across its radio and TV shows.
