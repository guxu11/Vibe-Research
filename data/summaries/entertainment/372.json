Of Hepburn, she said: \"The longevity of her career is inspiring to everyone.\" Blanchett also paid tribute to the film's director Martin Scorsese, telling him: \"I hope my son will marry your daughter.\" The Aviator's other awards came for cinematography, film editing, art direction and costume design. And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the \"beautiful legacy\" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford. \"You took a chance, man,\" he said. \"That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. \"Everybody's drowning in this love. Thank you for taking a chance and thank you for waiting 15 years to get me to do it.\"\n \n He broke down in tears when speaking about being whipped by his grandmother, whom he described as his first acting teacher, when he was young.
