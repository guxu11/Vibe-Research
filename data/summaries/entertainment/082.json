{"raw_text": "Aviator 'creator' in Oscars snub\n \n The man who said he got Oscar-nominated movie The Aviator off the ground and signed up Leonardo DiCaprio has been shut out of the Academy Awards race.\n \n Charles Evans Jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film, and won a producer's credit. But he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film Oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.\n \n Up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them. The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off. Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. The two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact Mr Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\n \n Ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. The eligible names for The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby were decided by Ampas' producers branch executive committee on Wednesday. The decision also saw Clint Eastwood get his third personal nomination for Million Dollar Baby. He is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. The Academy Awards ceremony will be held in Hollywood on 27 February. Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang, star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and House of Flying Daggers, is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "The man behind the film The Aviator has been nominated for a best film Oscar despite being excluded from the nominees due to his limited role in the production.

Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe first sentence mentions that Charles Evans, who signed up Leonardo DiCaprio for The Aviator, has been shut out of the Oscars race. He's a 'creator' in the Oscars sense, which probably means he's considered an Oscar-winner here but isn't selected due to other constraints.\n\nNext, it says that Evans battled over his role and eventually got a producer's credit. But the problem is that the Academy has only picked two producers out of four who can win the best film Oscar because they have limits on the number of nominees each film can have now.\n\nThe text then explains how The Aviator's producers were Michael Mann, Graham King, Mr. Evans (with Mr. Climan stepping down from his deputy role), and Mr. Mann. So, Evans was among four, but Ampas only picked two for the awards this time.\n\nThere's also a legal aspect where Evans sued Mann in 2001 claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it, and convinced DiCaprio, but said he left after the project. They had a deal out of court, not publicized yet except when Evans took photos with others at the time.\n\nThe Golden Globes didn't change anyone's nominations; Michael Eastwood got his third nomination for Million Dollar Baby. The ceremony is in Hollywood on February 27. Ziyi Zhang has joined as one of the presenters.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all these points: Charles Evans being excluded due to a producer limit, the situation with Ampas's producer list, the lawsuit Evans filed against Mann, the public reaction at the ceremony, and the new addition from China.\n\nLet me structure this into a concise summary. Start by stating that Charles Evans was out of the race but then explain his role in the project. Mention the process of how the film got nominated despite Ampas's limits. Highlight the legal aspect where he sued and the public's response at the ceremony. Include the addition of Ziyi Zhang as another producer.\n\nI need to make sure it's plain text without any explanations or formatting, just the summary.\n</think>\n\nCharles Evans was excluded from the Oscars race for The Aviator but played a pivotal role in developing the film, with Mr. Mann suing him in 2001 after claiming he came up with the project idea and left after it failed.
