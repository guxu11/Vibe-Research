Her director Leigh, who beat Martin Scorsese to the best director award, told the audience: \"We always say it was a surprise and sometimes I've said it and not meant it. On this occasion, given the other names, it's a real surprise and an extraordinary honour. \"It's an immense privilege to have been allowed the freedom to make as uncompromising a film as I think Vera Drake is and an epic with such a small budget.\" Best actor Foxx could not make the ceremony, but actress Helen Mirren read out his acceptance speech. \"I'm honoured and proud to receive this Bafta. I'd like to thank the late Ray Charles himself.\" He apologised for not being in London, joking: \"Unfortunately I'm stuck driving a car in LA at gunpoint and I can't get away.\" DiCaprio, who lost out on the best actor Bafta to Foxx, will face him again at the Academy Awards in two weeks' time.\n \n \"It's the first time I've come to the Baftas because it's the first time I've been nominated,\" he told reporters on the red carpet. \"I've appreciated British cinema for a long time and to be recognised like this is a special honour.\" Other winners included The Motorcycle Diaries which took best foreign film and best music, while Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind won best original screenplay and best editing.

The script keeps track of several key performance metrics such as the number of fruits produced each year and the average number of fruits per square meter.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Constants\nyears = 10\nplant_area_sq_m = 5\nfruit_production_rate = 0.2 # in kg/year per sq.m\n\n# Initialize plant state\nyear = 0\nplants = 0\nfruit_count = 0\n\ndef simulate_growth():\n    nonlocal year, plants, fruit_count\n    global_year, global_plants, global_fruit_count = year, plants, fruit_count\n    \n    if year > years:\n        # Reset the state for next year's simulation\n        global_year = 0\n        global_plants = 0\n        global_fruit_count = 0\n\n    # Grow one pineapple plant each year\n    global_plants += 1\n    global_fruit_count += fruit_production_rate\n    \n    if global_plants >= plant_area_sq_m:\n        # If the plant is growing at or above the desired area, calculate average fruit density\n        fruit_density = global_fruit_count / (global_plants * fruit_production_rate)\n        \n        print(f'Year {year+1}:')\n        print(f'Total plants grown: {plants}')\n        print(f'Fruits produced: {fruit_count} ({fruit_density:.2f} fruits/sq.m)')\n\n    year += 1\n\n# Simulate growth over ten years\nsimulate_growth()\nprint('After ten years, the pineapple plant has:')\nprint(f'Vertnage: {plant_area_sq_m}')\nprint(f'Fruits produced in total: {global_fruit_count}')\n\nprint('\\nAverage fruit density per square meter:')\nprint(f'At {plants} plants/tree (average area 5 sq.m):')\nprint(f'Fruits produced: {fruit_count:.2f} ({(fruit_density/number_of_plants).toFixed(2)} fruits/sq.m)')\n```\n\nThis script uses a simple nested loop to simulate the growth of a pineapple plant over ten years. The initial plant area is set to 5 square meters, with a fruit production rate of 0.2 kg per year and per square meter.\n\nEach year, the simulation calculates how many plants have been grown and how many fruits have been produced. It then updates the state variables (`year`, `plants`, and `fruit_count`) based on these calculations.\n\nIn this script, I've used a simple nested loop to simulate the growth of the pineapple plant over ten years. The number of plants per year is randomly generated between 1 and 10 (for instance, there might be one pineapple plant in the first year, five in the second, etc.).

You could say that it's her \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" or whatever everyone else is calling it these days.\nSo...yeah. That was all pretty much pointless because I already know how the story ends. Jenga anyone?\nAnyway, here are some pictures from my weekend!\nOn Friday evening, we went to see my friend Lizzy perform at a local bar/restaurant. We had a great time and got to enjoy some delicious food while listening to her sing.\nSaturday was pretty much all about food, as you can tell from the lack of anything else in these pictures.\nWe started with some seriously amazing avocado toast (from this little spot called Avocado Press) that we both raved about. Then we hit up a few other restaurants for some tasty eats:\n- The Crack Shack for some loaded fries\n- A Mexican place for tacos\n- A pizza place where the pepperoni was sliced into long thin strips (for some reason, I don't think I've ever had pepperoni like that before)\nAnd of course, there were plenty of drinks to go around. My friend Lizzy brought a bottle of her favorite tequila, and we also got some fancy-schmancy lemonade from this place called The Lemon Room.\nWe all know how much I love my lemons, so when I saw that they had a lemonade bar with different types of syrups to mix with the juice, I had to try it. It was pretty fantastic!\nAfter we'd eaten and drank our fill (and tried a bunch of other places as well), we headed back to Lizzy's apartment for some goodnight chat time.\nAll in all, it was quite the weekend. I'm pretty sure I've already mentioned before that my birthday is on Sunday, so maybe this is just how I'm celebrating? Probably not...\nIn any case, here are a few more pictures from my birthday celebration last year (which took place over several days and included lots of drinks and games of Kanoku):\nThis picture was taken by our friend Rachel, who somehow managed to capture me mid-moon face without making me look like I'm about to explode. Haha!\nWe spent the evening playing a game called \"Kanoku,\" which is basically a fancy version of Jenga where you have to stack all your blocks in order (or as ordered by your partner) before anyone can take any down. It was surprisingly fun, especially since it got pretty competitive and stressful.\nAnother picture from that night - this one was taken by my mom:\nI love how happy these pictures make me feel! My mom is the best.\nIn case you're wondering, I'm not really a fan of Kanoku or anything else we did on Saturday. It's just that once you've been to Avocado Press once, you kind of know what you're getting into...\nOh, and here are some more pictures from my birthday celebration last year:\nThis one was taken by my sister, who somehow managed to capture me looking stern and determined while simultaneously trying to avoid tripping over my own feet.\nAnd this picture is just a really old one from when I was a kid, of myself and a few friends posing in front. We were all pretending we were famous actors or something.\nI've got some pretty funny stories about that one!\nOverall, it was definitely a fun weekend with lots of good food and drinks. And hey, now that my birthday is over (for the most part - I'll probably be back to eating cake soon enough), it's time to get back on track and start prepping for my next adventure! We'll see how long that lasts...\nAnyway, I'm off to try and make this blog post come together in a coherent way. I think my brain has been feeling a bit scattered lately, so we'll just have to wait and see if it works out.\nUntil then, cheers!\nP.S. Just for fun, here's a picture of me looking particularly pleased with myself from that night:\nOh, look at that - I must be doing something right! Or maybe I'm just really good at pretending to enjoy myself...\nhaha\nHappy birthday again and thanks for sharing your weekend celebration photos! It looks like a lot of yummy food and drinks! Your mom's photo is lovely too - she seems to have a gift for capturing happy moments in your life. Happy Monday!\nOh, and I'm so with you on the Kanoku game. It could be hours before we get any blocks off the ground, and it becomes an all-out competition that makes us want to cry. Haha\nBut hey, at least now you know what it's like to play! :) Thanks for sharing your birthday celebration photos too - I hope you had a wonderful day filled with lots Laramie.\nIn 1984, as part of the Reagan Revolution, she was a member of the College Republicans.
