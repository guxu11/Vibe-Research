The American forensics expert said there were roughly 200,000-300,000 backlogged DNA samples in US labs. Yet these constituted just 10% of the total test backlog, said Dr Houck. Forensic pathologist Dr Patricia McFeeley said she had started to see the show's influence in dealing with the families of victims. \"What I find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case,\" she explained. \"For example, on television, the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. But when people find out that it can take several months, they can find that very difficult.\"\n \n Dr McFeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people's perceptions. The show's influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom, making lawyers jittery. \"Prosecutors fear the CSI effect with juries because, for example, they wonder: 'why wasn't everything tested?' Well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested,\" Dr Houck explained. \"Defence attorneys also worry about the CSI effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that's always accurate.\" However, he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field. \"My university course started with four graduates in 1999; we're now the largest major on campus - with 400 students,\" he said. Dr Houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: \"There's more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "People have unrealistic expectations of forensic science due to TV shows like CSI, which portray it as always working and providing accurate results.

The text talks about CSI TV shows giving an unrealistic view of forensic science because real experts consider that viewers have these ungrounded expectations. It mentions how evidence submitted to labs shot up due to the success of the shows, especially as there's a backlog and many large ones. Lawyers were worried about this skewed view affecting their role in jury decisions.\n\nThe text also mentions that crime scene investigation (CSI) and its subsidiaries like CSI: Miami and CSI: New York are very popular with audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Each episode involves forensic scientists using science for solving crimes, which is often seen as a \"CSI effect.\"\n\nDr. Max Houck from West Virginia University explained how viewers watch the TV shows, leading to increased evidence submissions. There were over 200,000 DNA samples in labs, but this was just 10% of the backlog. Dr Patricia McFeeley noted that forensic pathologists started using the show's methods for handling victims' families. She explained how viewers could get information too quickly about death times, making it harder to trust the evidence.\n\nThe text also touches on the accuracy of determining time of death being lower than people perceive, which affected jurors in the court. Professors are concerned that they come across as jumpy due to this CSI effect. Dr Houck said the show had both positive and negative effects. His university course started with four graduates and now has 400 students. The conclusion is that there's a need for better funding for forensic science at universities.\n\nI need to condense all these points into one concise summary, making sure to include key ideas like CSI shows' unrealistic view, increased evidence submissions, skewed juror views, the popularity of CSI, and the mix of positive and negative effects from the show.
