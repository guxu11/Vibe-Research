Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.\n\nThe first sentence mentions that a controversial film with Kevin Bacon won top honours. Kevin is known for acting in films like \"The pink Panther\" and \"A Few Good Men.\" That's good to note because it highlights his association with controversial content.\n\nNext, the film is about a convicted paedophile. It's directed by Nicole Kassell, and the director says it tackled the issue sensitively. This ties back to Kevin Bacon since he starred in the film as Bacon. I should mention that Kevin acted alongside Bacon on \"The pink Panther.\"\n\nThe film won the Satyajit Ray Award, named after an Indian director. It's low-budget, focusing on a child molester trying to rebuild his life after 12 years in jail. The judges praised it for insightful and sensitive work, which is a key detail.\n\nAnother award was given to Amma Asante for her debut film A Way Of Life.
