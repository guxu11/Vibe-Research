He is awaiting a second trial after an original conviction was thrown out. \"I'm not pleased,\" Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee said. \"He will not make another video in my jail.\" Footage for the video was filmed by two crews who had permission to interview C-Murder - one from Court TV and one from a local cable show.\n \n But Mr Lee said he did not know the rapper had filmed the video and made an album behind bars, and said he was fooled into letting the cameras in.
