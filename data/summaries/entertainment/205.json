Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main point seems to be that the British producers of US Wife Swap are suing Fox, their TV network, saying they took a copycat approach on their show. They're suing because they claim their product is in violation of broadcast laws. \n\nThey filed a damages claim for $18 million against Fox, which I think was before Fox's Trading Spouses. The show was first aired in 2003 and hit Channel 4 when ABC bought it. ABC supported the action without any explanations, while Fox didn't know about the legal details.\n\nThe show started as Trading Moms but changed to Trading Mom's, avoiding confusion with the Fox version. NBC had similar issues with another show, The Next Great Champ, which they thought was hurriedly produced because they wanted it first screened, even though there were legal violations in place. Fox's show ended up being a flop, while NBC's show is set to start next month.\n\nSo, the key ideas are: \n1. British producers sue Fox for using a copycat approach.\n2. They have $18 million damages claimed against Fox.\n3. The show was first aired in 2003 and has sold millions of copies.\n4. ABC supported the legal action but didn't provide details, while Fox didn't know about it either.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all these points without adding any extra information that wasn't there before the summary. Also, ensure that the summary is concise, only in plain text with no explanations or formatting. \n\nWait, do I have all the important details? The show's first aired in 2003, sold over a million copies, ABC's stance on supporting it without more info, and Fox's lack of knowledge about the legal action. That seems comprehensive.\n\nSo putting that together into a summary, making sure to mention each key point clearly.\n</think>\n\nThe British producers of US Wife Swap are suing Fox for taking a copycat approach on their show, which was first aired in 2003 and sold over a million copies.
