Owen has already been made bookmakers' favourite for best supporting actor for the role in Closer that has already clinched him a Golden Globe award.\n \n And it is the first nomination for actress Okonedo, chosen for her performance in Hotel Rwanda, about the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It is also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who told BBC News 24 she had not thought the film would appeal to Academy voters. \"It was an extraordinary time making the film and I can't believe what has happened this morning,\" she said. \"I hope it just shows Mike up to be the extraordinary filmmaker he is. \"We are also dealing with a very difficult subject matter and it is amazing to have it accepted in this way.\" Leigh, who had previously received three Oscar nominations for Secrets and Lies and Topsy Turvy, told BBC News 24 the latest success was \"amazing\". He said: \"We hoped that Imelda Staunton would get a nomination but I never expected to get director and screenplay. It's just absolutely wonderful.\n \n \"I think people are aware that it's about life - and I hope it is the warmth and compassion that really talks to people.\" Winslet said she was \"ecstatic\" about the fourth nomination of her career. \"Being nominated means so much to me. To be nominated for a film that was released a while ago, I feel so honoured and overwhelmed,\" she said. John Woodward, chief executive of the UK Film Council, said it was \"extremely heartening\" to see British filmmaking talent recognised on the global stage. \"Britain has a hugely talented industry and these nominations show why National Lottery investment in film pays major dividends for our culture and economy.\" Among a total of 24 British nominees, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart are up for best original song for Learn To Be Lonely, from The Phantom of the Opera movie.\n \n Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, is also up for The Phantom of the Opera.
