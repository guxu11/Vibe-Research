Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the Aviator won the Best Original Score Prize, which is rare because only three movies win that. It's their first time for a million-dollar movie, so that's significant. The director was Martin Scorsese, who previously directed films like The Dark Knight and The Godfather. Their star was Leonardo DiCaprio in a high-profile role.\n\nOther notable films included Million Dollar Baby by Clint Eastwood with Hilary Swank as the lead actress. Sideways had a best screenplay win by Shontal D'Souza for \"The Four Keys.\" Both the Aviator and Million Dollar Baby were nominated for Best Original Score, which is unusual because only two other movies have received this award since 1978.\n\nJamie Foxx was also nominated in another category, but his win went to best actor in a musical/comedy. Clive Owen won with Cliveux' Closer for supporting roles. \n\nThe Aviator won three awards, while Million Dollar Baby and Sideways each got two. It's noted that only one million-dollar film has won two Globes before. The review by Annette Bening praised the acting talent and director.\n\nHillary Swank also won Best Actress in a musical/comedy with Julia Stiles for \"Being Julia.\" She praised Martin Scorsese, acknowledging he was a visionary director. \n\nClive Owen and Natalie Portman shared prizes for supporting roles. The Aviator's performance as Howard Hughes gave it an edge against other films.\n\nThe show also won Best Original Score, which is rare with only three previous winners. The Globes split awards by genre\u2014dramas and musicals/comedies. \n\nThere was a mention of TV categories too: Best Original Song went to Teri Hatcher after competing against others in the series. Robin Williams received Cecil B. DeMille Award for career achievement, dedicating his life to Christopher Reeve.\n\nThe Golden Globes are part of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and honor overseas films from Los Angeles. They're not like the Oscars where only one category exists. \n\nOther actors got nominations too, like Jason Bateman taking Best TV Actor in a Musical or Comedy. The Aviator's win was surprising given the competition.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all key points without adding any extra information beyond what's needed for a concise summary.\n</think>\n\nAviator won three Golds, best score and best original song, while Million Dollar Baby and Sideways shared two.
