First, I should read through the entire paragraph carefully to understand the key points.\n\nThe main issues are that the Police Federation is opposing giving CSOs extra power, specifically detaining suspects for up to 30 minutes in potentially tough situations. They extended these powers from six police areas across England and Wales on Thursday to all forces there. The federation claims that CSOs don't have the experience or safety equipment for such detentions, but the government sees it as a help for \"building safe communities.\"\n\nThe chairman of the Federation, Jan Berry, argues against this power. She says CSOs should act like an \"eyes and ears\" by waiting for police to arrive. This change in their role will make them more visible in combat, helping to reduce crime.
