{"raw_text": "'Nuclear dumpsite' plan attacked\n \n Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded \"deeply irresponsible\" by the Liberal Democrats.\n \n The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK. The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a \"nuclear dumpsite\".\n \n Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a \"sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries\". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.\n \n Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to \u00a3680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: \"I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. But now our worst fears have been confirmed. \"Once again Britain's environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the Treasury and DTI. \"This is a terrible attempt to offload some of the \u00a348bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites. \"The Energy Act was supposed to help Britain clean up, but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite. \"The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain's neck.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Plans by the UK government to store intermediate-level nuclear waste in the country have been criticized as \"deeply irresponsible\" by the Liberal Democrats.

The government has announced plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be stored in the UK, but critics argue this would lead to a \"nuclear dumpsite\" scenario where the UK becomes a hub for radioactive waste storage globally.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have been particularly vocal about their concerns, accusing the government of turning Britain into a \"nuclear dumpsite\". They point out that the UK has already hosted several international nuclear waste shipments, and that the new policy would lead to further shipments from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats also argue that the new policy would raise up to \u00a3680 million for the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency (NDA), which is responsible for decommissioning nuclear power plants and disposing of radioactive waste. They point out that this would be a significant increase in costs, and that it would divert resources away from other important areas such as renewable energy and climate change mitigation.\n\nThe government has defended its decision to allow foreign nuclear waste storage, arguing that the UK's nuclear industry is already well-established and that there are no plans to build new nuclear power plants in the near future. However, critics argue that this would be a short-term solution that would ultimately lead to more long-term problems.\n\nOverall, the controversy surrounding the government's plans to allow foreign nuclear waste storage in the UK highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the nuclear industry, as well as the importance of ensuring that safety and environmental concerns are taken seriously.", "deepseek-r1:1.5b": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this text about a nuclear dumpsite plan by the UK government. The user wants me to summarize it concisely, focusing on key ideas and details.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the provided text carefully. It starts by calling the plan \"deeply irresponsible\" because of the criticism from the Liberal Democrats. Then, it mentions that intermediate nuclear waste (ILW) is being shipped back to the UK now. The government has confirmed this, and the funds will go towards their clean-up program.\n\nBut the Lib Dems objectify this by accusing ministers of turning Britain into a dumpsite. They argue that under current contracts, only some waste goes back but not all. So far, none has been sent back yet. In the future, they'll send back highly-radioactive waste to Germany or Japan, and intermediate waste from other countries like Spain, Italy, etc., will be kept in the UK.\n\nThe Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) says this is a sixfold reduction in shipments. They also plan for high-level waste to return sooner. Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt points out that this could cost up to \u00a3680 million under new plans. But environmental groups and Lib Dems are skeptical, calling it a mistake because Britain is being pushed into a nuclear dumpsite by the financial and trade bodies.\n\nThey argue that the nuclear industry should play its role, not just clean up. The energy law was supposed to help but now they're paying for it by making Britain a dumpsite. They highlight how much the UK has spent on cleaning nuclear sites, saying this is a big loss.\n\nSo, the key points are: criticism from Lib Dems about turning Britain into a dumpsite; confirmation of ILW storage in the UK with funds for clean-up; concerns that future waste goes back to home countries with higher levels; government's claims of a sixfold reduction and promise of more efficient clean-ups. But critics say it's ignoring health and environmental needs.\n\nI need to condense this into a summary without explanations, just plain text. I'll include the main points about the criticism, the action taken, the criticisms from Lib Dems, and the implications for the nuclear industry.\n</think>\n\nThe UK government's plan to allow foreign nuclear waste to be stored in the UK has faced criticism from the Liberal Democrats, calling it a \"deeply irresponsible\" move.
