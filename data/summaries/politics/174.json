The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave.

An executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report. Ministerial responsibility for Carstairs rests with Rhona Brankin, the deputy health minister.

She said: \"Ministers were told of that, notified of it, but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off. \"They do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision.\" Ferguson, who slashed a man in a doctors' surgery in Coatbridge in 1994, had been out to see his fianc&#233;e Annabella Holmes, 47, whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in South Lanarkshire.
