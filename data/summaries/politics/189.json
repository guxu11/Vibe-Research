{"raw_text": "Blair congratulates Bush on win\n \n Tony Blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with George Bush and working with him during his second term as president.\n \n Mr Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was \"fractured, divided and uncertain\", Mr Blair said. It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.\n \n But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by \"military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values\" he added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most \"pressing political challenge\" of the present day, Mr Blair warned. The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to \"build anew their alliance\".\n \n \"All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. It is urgent that we do so.\" Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election \"a true celebration of American democracy\". The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his \"warmest congratulations\", saying: \"We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.\n \n Mr Bush's first task was to \"rebuild a sense of domestic purpose\" within the US, he said. Mr Kennedy said: \"Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.\" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an \"umbilical cord\" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.\n \n \"Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. \"Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.\" Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.\n \n Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst paragraph: Blair congratulates Bush on winning. I should include that he looks forward to continuing the relationship during his second term. That\u2019s a key point.\n\nNext part: Mr. Bush's re-election happened crucially because the world was fractured, divided, and uncertain. He mentioned working on issues like poverty, Middle East, terrorism, and global terrorism. That's important context about the crisis he\u2019s addressing.\n\nThen, Blair stressed that solving the Middle East conflict isn't just military might but also demonstrating strength in common values. So, he's saying it needs diplomacy, not just force. This is a major political challenge.\n\nHe also urged Europe and the US to build a new alliance. That suggests building on the progress made in dealing with terrorism, which aligns with his focus earlier.\n\nLater, John Kerry's campaign was mentioned, with a focus on making the election a celebration of American democracy. This ties into his role as president and the significance for Britain given its special relationship.\n\nMr. Bush said to rebuild domestic purpose within the US. Kennedy emphasized more sensitive relations with allies beyond just global efforts against terrorism. This shows that he's looking to preserve trust and unity.\n\nLib Dem foreign affairs expert, Menzies Campbell, talked about a potential new administration bringing an umbilical cord between Bush and UK. So, this administration would tie back closer to Blair, which is significant for understanding their relationship post-bush.\n\nThe Iraq issue could be a bit of a long-term issue for the US. Even before knowing who won, Blair was urging action on climate change at his first meeting with a candidate. This points out that climate change is another important topic ahead.\n\nIn a debate, Beckett said the US would act on global warming despite Bush's refusal. That highlights the US' commitment to environmental policies even when other countries are not supporting them. However, Ebell opposed this and suggested there wouldn't be changes in the US stance because of independent scientists elsewhere.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to make sure I capture Blair's emphasis on relationships, the global crisis, domestic rebuilding, building alliances, emphasizing American democracy, Iraq implications, climate change efforts, and the ongoing tensions with other countries. Also, note that the Middle East conflict is central.\n\nI think I've covered all these points in my summary.\n</think>\n\nLiberal Democrat Blair emphasizes his continued relationship with former President Bush during his second term, noting a crucial global crisis involving issues like poverty, terrorism, and global unity.
