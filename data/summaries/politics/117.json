Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first sentence: \"Boaternityrld calls for Lords speaker.\" I think the user meant \"Betty Boothroyd\" because the name is already mentioned earlier in the context of her being the first woman in the Commons Speaker role. So that's a key point\u2014she's calling for someone to fill the House of Lords' role.\n\nNext, the second part mentions that the House of Lords needs its own Speaker and that peers should lead reform efforts. This gives another important point: the House of Lords should have its own Speaker, not just a single person in some form.\n\nThe third section talks about Baroness Boothroyd's perspective. She called out Tony Blair for initiating reforms without clear outcomes, which is interesting because he was Labour's leader. Her statement on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost show that she thinks the government needs to take care of things themselves after Labour removed most of the Lords' hereditary peers. That means there were two phases of reform.\n\nThe fourth part comes from Lord Falconer, who also expressed concern about the relationship between the House of Lords and the Commons. He suggested they need to work together on reforms. The lord chancellor is currently both the House of Lords speaker and head of the judiciary with cabinet responsibilities.\n\nFinally, Lady Boothroyd again mentions that the lord chancellor should not hold the role of Speaker; it's too much of a disjointed position. She emphasizes looking after the House of Lords instead.\n\nSo putting this all together, I need to make sure the summary includes key points about her calling for a separate Speaker, the current government's role without clear outcomes, Falconer's concerns about the relationship between houses, and Boothroyd's support for a better Speaker.\n</think>\n\nBoaternityrld calls for Lords speaker  \nBetty Boothroyd has said the House of Lords needs its own Speaker.  \nPeers should lead reform efforts in the House of Lords.  \nBaroness Boothroyd stated that Tony Blair initiated reforms without clear outcomes.

The speaker is currently held by Lady Boothroyd, a prominent British politician and member of the Labour Party. She has expressed her desire for a more independent and autonomous position for the House of Lords. Her views have been influenced by her time as the Commons Speaker under Tony Blair's leadership. Some critics argue that it is not necessary to have a separate Speaker, as the current one already takes on the role of head of the judiciary and Cabinet Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II. The issue lies in the fact that these positions are held by politicians themselves, who are expected to prioritize their political careers over their duties as Speakers.
