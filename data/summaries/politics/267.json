{"raw_text": "UKIP's secret weapon?\n \n By any measure, New Yorker Dick Morris is that thing Americans love over everything else - a winner.\n \n This is the man who, some pundits believe, was almost single-handedly responsible for Bill Clinton's sensational 1992 comeback victory. But Morris is no ideologue. He has worked as election strategist for any number of Republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from Mexico to Uruguay. Now he is back in London as the UK Independence Party's not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the Ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko. If there is one regular criticism levelled at Morris, it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances. That he enjoys the game more than the politics.\n \n So why Britain and why UKIP which, despite its recent EU election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election. On this subject, Morris appears almost evangelical.\n \n \"I was on a cruise in the Mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was UKIP leader Roger Knapman. \"I had just written a piece saying how the English Channel was now wider than the Atlantic which he liked and it went from there\". But what is it about UKIP that particularly attracts him? Many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics. \"I think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism\". A great soundbite, but a surprise coming from a New Yorker post 11 September. \"It is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better, who don't believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined. \"That's international bankers, the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and, primarily, the European Union\".\n \n So he is out to help UKIP take Britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. And he is scathing of the Tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable. \"The Tory party is schizophrenic about Europe. But until somebody says they are willing to leave the EU they can't possibly re-negotiate anything (as Michael Howard is pledged to do). \"It's like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying: 'before I can proceed with the robbery I want to make clear I am not going to shoot anybody'\". Possibly a very American analogy, but another great soundbite. \"The basic point is that the EU seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from Britain - and we oppose that and the Tories cannot be trusted to oppose it\".\n \n So is UKIP's job to destroy the Tories, as former member Robert Kilroy-Silk once notoriously declared? \"No. The aim of UKIP is to withdraw from the EU and if it has any relation to the Tories it is to stiffen the Tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough UKIP vote so that we move the Tories in the direction they are refusing to move.\n \n \"But it's not just to shift the Tories. I think UKIP had a huge amount to do with Tony Blair's decision to hold a referendum on the European constitution and I think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro\". And, while we are on the subject of Mr Kilroy-Silk, Mr Morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites. \"Robert Kilroy Silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one\".\n \n So what is the big plan for the general election. How will he achieve the breakthrough? \"Look, we are not going to be forming the next government,\" he said. Neither does UKIP have to fight every seat. As with the 2004 US presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in Britain. So, with limited resources, the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the Commons. He also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll. \"The internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries). People just did it\". \"Anything can happen in the next general election. There is an inherent instability at the moment. \"Labour and the Tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice\".\n \n That might, he suggests, lead to a hung parliament with UKIP and others holding the balance of power. It is a huge task, surely. But there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is Labour's for the taking. UKIP's performance in last year's European elections was just such a shocker and showed that Mr Morris may have a point about the new consensus. And after all, he has a reputation to sustain.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "UKIP's secret weapon: New Yorker Dick Morris, who has worked as election strategist for Republicans and politicians from Mexico to Uruguay, is believed to be working on UK Independence Party's electoral strategy in London. Despite recent EU election successes, UKIP is unlikely to win the general election. Morris appears evangelical about his role in helping UKIP take Britain out of the European Union, which he believes is unreformable and undemocratic. He opposes the Tory party's stance on Europe.

He believes the EU poses a threat to democracy and argues UKIP's goal is to weaken the EU's influence by increasing their vote share.

Dick Morris, the New Yorker, helped build the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which is trying to pull out of the European Union.\n\nThe article discusses David Morris, a former American politician, who gained notoriety for his work with Viktor Yushchenko in Ukraine. He has worked on numerous political matters, including the Brexit vote and the US presidential election. Despite this, Morris remains loyal to UKIP, particularly due to his belief that the EU is unstable and should be reformed.\n\nMorris argues that UKIP's goal is not simply to shift the Tories' position but also to create a situation where the new government can move the entire decision-making process away from Britain and instead focus on other European countries. He believes in using the internet as a way to bring voters to his side, even though he doesn't believe it will be enough alone.\n\nThe article mentions several points about UKIP's strategy for the general election:\n\n1. It aims to have a significant number of votes in the Commons.\n2. The goal is to target specific seats and end the day with a large group of members.\n3. Morris suggests that relying on the internet could lead to a hung parliament, though he still believes it may result in some surprises.\n\nOverall, the article highlights David Morris's loyalty to UKIP despite the lack of clear electoral success in his previous elections.", "qwen2.5:1.5b": "Dick Morris returns as adviser to UK Independence Party, arguing EU is undemocratic and anti-democratic.

Despite his tendency to switch allegiances, Morris is drawn to UKIP due to their emphasis on the threat posed by bureaucratic bodies like the EU and international organizations. He views the UKIP as a potential catalyst for Brexit and believes it could influence policy decisions regarding Europe within the Conservative party. Morris envisions the 2015 general election outcome being decided in a handful of swing seats, with significant internet participation shaping voter opinions. His strategy includes targeting specific seats to secure parliamentary representation, potentially leading to a hung parliament where UKIP holds the balance of power. Despite his reputation and expertise, there remains skepticism about UKIP's likelihood of winning in the general election, but Morris' past successes suggest he might surprise again.", "opencoder:1.5b": "UKIP's secret weapon?\nBy any measure, New Yorker Dick Morris is that thing Americans love over everything else - a winner.\nThis is the man who, some pundits believe, was almost single-handedly responsible for Bill Clinton's sensational 1992 comeback victory.

The user provided a detailed text on UKIP's strategy for the upcoming general election in the UK. Let me start by reading through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence is about Dick Morris and how he's beloved by Americans. Then there's some critique from pundits that says Morris was responsible for Clinton's success, but they disagree because Morris isn't ideologue. That seems like a key point: Morris's political stance despite his controversial views. He's not just an advocate; he actively participates in politics.\n\nNext, Morris returned to the UK as part of UKIP after aiding Viktor Yushchenko. He claims to be evangelical and talks about the growing influence of expert bodies that don't support democracy but believe in their solution. This is a big deal because it suggests he's trying to push UKIP out of its current position as an undemocratic, bureaucratic organization.\n\nHe also mentions fighting against the Tory party which he thinks is too resistant. He argues that his actions will help UKIP take Britain out of this organization and ultimately leave it in a position where they can't be reformulated. He contrasts the EU's desire for political integration with the UK's desire for separation from it, aiming to move the Tories away.\n\nMorris has been involved with Tony Blair on a referendum about the European constitution and is against joining the euro, while supporting Britain alone. He also talks about his team not working well together, which he refers to as \"a good idea\" for their party. They mention that his efforts could have significant impacts both in the US and the UK.\n\nHe suggests focusing on swing seats in the election but uses the internet as a factor. The user mentioned the 2004 presidential election was influenced by blogs where people shared their views online. He also warns about instability at the moment, suggesting the next election might surprise many without everyone being on board.\n\nMorris is known for being pragmatic and has done well in European elections. However, he's not perfect, but his strategy seems to have potential. The summary should capture the main points: Morris as a strategic figure, his aim of leaving UKIP behind, fighting against Tories, focusing on swing seats with the internet as part of his plan.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any explanations or formatting, just the concise summary. Let me structure this by highlighting key elements like Morris's role, his strategy, the contrast between UK and EU policies, the impact he hopes to achieve, and some predictions about the election.\n</think>\n\nDick Morris is seen as a strategic figure, aiming to leave UKIP behind in the upcoming general election. Despite being controversial due to his political stance, he actively participates in politics, often advocating for reform despite the perceived resistance from parties like the Tory. His strategy focuses on winning swing seats and leveraging the internet's influence during the 2004 election to show potential impact. He hopes to shift power and leave UKIP in a position where it can no longer align with the need for political separation, potentially leading to a hung parliament or significant surprises in the next election.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "UKIP's secret weapon is their strategic alliance with opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko in Ukraine, where they helped him win the presidency in 2004.

UKIP strategist Dick Morris believes this is the key to their electoral success and has worked with opposition candidates from Mexico to Urgyana, notably former Mexican President Vicente Fox. However, Morris is known for his ability to switch allegiances and enjoy victory in general elections. Despite this, UKIP seems set on a path towards targeting \"swing seats\" that will decide the outcome, potentially leading to a hung parliament with UKIP and others holding the balance of power.

Morris argues that UKIP\u2019s role is not to destroy the Conservative Party but to pressure it into adopting a stronger anti-EU stance. He credits UKIP with influencing Tony Blair\u2019s decision to hold a referendum on the European constitution and reject the euro.

He is particularly critical of the Tory party for being \"schizophrenic\" about Europe, suggesting they cannot genuinely renegotiate their position while remaining in the EU.\n\nMorris aims to bolster UKIP's presence, making it a significant force in Parliament by targeting key swing seats and leveraging the internet as a powerful tool for voter engagement. He expects a hung parliament with other parties holding the balance of power, given the tight consensus between Labour and Conservatives.\n\nWhile most still favor Labour to win, Morris anticipates surprises in the general election due to UKIP's impact from its strong performance in 2014 European elections.
