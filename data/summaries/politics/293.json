{"raw_text": "Kilroy launches 'Veritas' party\n \n Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to \"change the face of British politics\" as he launched his new party. Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party, said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration. He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for \"truth\" - would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.\n \n Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat. He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader. UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.\n \n Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. \"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said. \"I will be standing at the next general election. I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in. \"And, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.\"\n \n Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would \"deliver better\" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down. Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\n \n Veritas? It's the BNP in an expensive suit!\n \n It's all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that 'Veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in \"lies and spin\", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'Veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend. In my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-Islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television.\n \n I think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. It really is time that the UK government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. In addition as an Ashfield constituent I would be more than interested in Kilroy -Silk opposing Geoff Hoon!!\n \n Good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. Let's hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe. We benefit enormously from our membership of the EU, we need to be at the heart of Europe, leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go, not running away from it.\n \n All mouth and trousers. A clown. Trouble is, any votes he collects may just end up helping New Labour into a third term.\n \n Whatever Kilroy-Silk and UKIP do, none of their anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England. This new party might gain support from right-wing England, but will have little impact in Wales or Scotland.\n \n Hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. England needs Europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, we can't rely on the USA forever!\n \n At last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election. The electorate is disillusioned with British politics. Kilroy has one agenda - the UK - and I'll be voting for him.\n \n Both UKIP and RK-S are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. The interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people's bickering that who, in the overall scheme of things, really cares about their petty tiff?\n \n Many people believe you Kilroy. You may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.\n \n The very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating. One can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls.\n \n I've always thought that Kilroy-Silk was a self-publicising, egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.\n \n Brilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!\n \n Having seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. Hopefully the UKIP members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.\n \n Fantastic news. Pro-Europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. The Conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s, and the extreme anti-Europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local, European and general elections. Robert Kilroy-Silk's ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters') worst enemy.\n \n As a euro-enthusiast I could not be more delighted by Kilroy-Silk's behaviour. He took a party that was just building up a head of steam, and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d'etat, he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. The closer to straight-down-the-middle the better, as far as I am concerned, but in any eventuality, the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.\n \n If every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose, we'd have ballot papers a mile long! You've got to hand it to Kilroy-Silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief.\n \n Whilst not being a great fan of Kilroy I do agree with his comments about the UKIP leadership, and like him I am also leaving UKIP. I believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the EU and to show our people what belonging to the EU really means. The EU's comments last week about Michael Howard's plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the EU and not individual member states. The sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better\n \n Does anyone else think that it is ironic that Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk has used a Latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old British' name? Is this indicative of the man - contradictory, vain and pompous?\n \n I think Mr Kilroy-Silk has got a very good point. British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. They are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. As a result I feel our democracy is being abused and I want it stopped. If Mr Kilroy-Silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.\n \n Honestly, who really cares? Man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.\n \n As one of Kilroy-Silk's East Midlands constituents I hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. I feel insulted by having him represent me in the European Parliament.\n \n UKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. Someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of UKIP's democratic nature.\n \n Kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead UKIP are not. He tried to make it work, but they didn't seem to want to grow up. He was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy. Good luck to the man, I say.\n \n Oh please! This is an amusing irrelevance. There is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive 'Eurosceptic' argument. They will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed, more democratic, more dynamic Europe Union. Future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness.\n \n The refreshing thing about Robert is that he is open, honest and straight. What other politician can claim this. I have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. I shall be voting for him.\n \n The electorate of the East Midlands voted not for Kilroy-Silk but for the UKIP. Kilroy-Silk was made an MEP because of his position on the UKIP's party list. He has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the European Parliament.\n \n I wouldn't write off Kilroy-Silk. While he's a clown and a one man band at the moment, he's a populist and that's always dangerous.The man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters, that seems to be one of the factors in success.\n \n Good luck to Kilroy though I think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and UKIP because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment UKIP have the upper hand while Veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.\n \n The man I once found cringe worthy on Day time TV, could well turn out to be my country's knight in shining armour. He expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them. Kilroy Silk has secured my vote, and many more like me. What's more, I look forward to the day when he claims victory, wrecks the EU, and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever!\n \n Great Stuff. The longer the UK dithers over Europe, the richer we in Ireland become, as the only English-speaking country fully committed to Europe. Oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them.\n \n This is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.\n \n Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!\n \n It is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP. Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk. It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.\n \n UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.\n \n If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.\n \n So UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!\n \n Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!\n \n Every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country. Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities. Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and your time may have come!\n \n Well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party. It's all flash and no real policy here\n \n Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.\n \n Veritas? The name will doom it. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that?\n", "llama3.2:1b": "This text appears to be a rant or diatribe written by someone who is strongly opposed to Robert Kilroy-Silk's (RKS) candidacy for election as an MEP. The author expresses various negative opinions about RKS, his policies, and his leadership style.\n\nSome of the specific criticisms mentioned include:\n\n* His Eurosceptic views are not a genuine rejection of Europe, but rather an attempt to use the term \"Veritas\" to mask one's own biases.\n* He is a \"one-man band\" who thinks he can be elected on a platform of simplicity and honesty, despite having no real policy or leadership experience.\n* His party, UKIP, is weak and lacks a strong base for success.\n* He has shown a lack of courage and honesty in his views, particularly regarding issues such as immigration, asylum, and bureaucracy.\n\nThe author also expresses skepticism about RKS's chances of winning the election, citing the fact that he was \"good enough\" to lead UKIP but not good enough to follow. They suggest that RKS should consider stepping down from his current role or starting a new party with different leadership.\n\nOn a more philosophical level, the author uses Latin words and phrases such as \"Veritas\", which is commonly used in historical or literary contexts, to express their criticisms of RKS's politics and policies. However, it is not entirely clear how they see these terms relating to Euroscepticism, as many readers may not be familiar with the context.\n\nSome other notable points from the text include:\n\n* The author seems to believe that UKIP has had a significant impact on British politics due to Kilroy-Silk's efforts.\n* They express disappointment and frustration at the fact that RKS was able to achieve this level of success despite being one of many candidates in an election.\n* They suggest that RKS should prioritize his own legacy over any potential future achievements, citing his willingness to step down or start a new party if necessary.\n\nOverall, the text is a passionate and emotive expression of opposition to Kilroy-Silk's candidacy, with a strong sense of disappointment and frustration.", "llama3.2:3b": "This is a collection of opinions and thoughts from various individuals about Robert Kilroy-Silk's decision to leave UKIP and start his own party, Veritas.

Here are some key themes emerging from this analysis:\n\n**Support for Kilroy-Silk:** \n\n* **Voice for the Voiceless:** Many people appreciate his outspokenness and direct communication style, even if they disagree with all of it. He is seen as a breath of fresh air compared to traditional politicians.\n* **Authenticity & Integrity:** There's a strong appreciation for his honesty and willingness to challenge the status quo.  He appeals to those who believe in transparency and straightforwardness. \n* **Shared Concerns about Europe:** His Eurosceptic views resonate with a large segment of the population, especially concerning immigration, bureaucracy, and spending on European projects.\n\n**Criticism and Concerns:**\n\n* **Divisions within UKIP:** There's disappointment at the internal division within UKIP as it impacts its ability to be a meaningful political force in Parliament.\n* **Lack of Detailed Policy:** Many critics point out that his new party is lacking concrete policy proposals, leaving them uncertain about what he stands for beyond \"taking back control\" of the UK. \n* **The \"Veritas\" Name Question:** The name seems to invite skepticism and mockery amongst some, raising questions about the sincerity of his anti-EU stance.\n\n**Potential for Impact:**\n\n* **Popularity Surge for Kilroy-Silk:**  His departure from UKIP has created a vacuum, and he may attract a significant following if his message resonates with voters.\n* **Broader Appeal Needed:** To be truly successful, he needs to articulate a broader vision of \"taking back control\" that goes beyond the EU. \n* **Impact on the Political Landscape:**  The split within UKIP will have lasting consequences for both parties, as they grapple to define their political identities and win over voters in the years to come.\n\n**Overall: A Mixed Picture**\n\n\nThe comments paint a complex picture of how the public perceives Kilroy-Silk's departure from UKIP and the launch of his new party.  He is seen as a maverick who challenges conventional political discourse, but his success will hinge on his ability to translate that voice into concrete policy and broaden his appeal beyond a narrow Eurosceptic agenda.

Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Political Dynamics**:\n   - The discussion revolves around the internal politics within UKIP (UK Independence Party) and its relationship with Robert Kilroy-Silk, who is attempting to create a new political party.\n   - There's concern about how the split could affect both UKIP itself and future electoral prospects.\n\n2. **Party Leadership and Governance**:\n   - The conversation highlights issues around leadership change within the existing party structure (UKIP).\n   - It touches on the importance of maintaining unity among different parties that may have similar views but are working separately, which can dilute their impact if they're not effectively coordinated.\n\n3. **Policy Advocacy vs. Party Formation**:\n   - The debate underscores the tension between a party's core policy (UKIP\u2019s focus on withdrawing from the European Union) and its emerging political structure.\n   - There is skepticism about whether a new party with similar views could make significant progress, citing UKIP's current lead position.\n\n4. **Latin Names in Political Campaigns**:\n   - The use of Latin names like Veritas for parties often raises questions about their perceived neutrality or ideological purity.\n   - This debate reflects the ongoing tension between formal political discourse and everyday language usage (in this case, \"Veritas\" suggests an emphasis on truthfulness).\n\n5. **Quality of Leadership and Policy Focus**:\n   - The discussion is a reminder that effective leadership in politics often goes beyond just advocating for a single issue.\n   - It emphasizes the importance of focusing not just on policy but also quality of governance and public service.\n\n6. **Political Influence and Media Impact**:\n   - The comment about sending Irish immigrants \"back to England\" suggests how political sentiments can be influenced through media and public opinion.\n   - There is a recognition that for many voters, UKIP\u2019s appeal may come from its unique brand rather than policy itself.\n\n7. **Future Prospects of Politicians with Egos**:\n   - The statement about Kilroy-Silk being \"too cringe worthy on daytime TV\" suggests how politicians' public personas can reflect broader societal values.\n   - It implies that future politicians might be expected to balance these aspects and remain relatable while maintaining integrity.\n\nIn summary, the conversation is a blend of discussions around party formation, policy advocacy, leadership strategies, and media influence. It underscores the dynamic nature of political organizations and the challenges they face in trying to maintain their positions and appeal amidst changing public sentiment.", "qwen2.5:3b": "The varied responses about Robert Kilroy-Silk's new party, Veritas, highlight both excitement and skepticism. Many see him as a breath of fresh air in British politics, someone willing to be honest and direct rather than part of an establishment they view as corrupt or ineffective.\n\nSome supporters argue that the name \"Veritas\" (meaning truth in Latin) is appropriate for Kilroy-Silk's stance on European issues. They believe it encapsulates his commitment to clear, unambiguous statements about what he sees as the problems with EU membership and the need for a reformed Europe Union.\n\nHowever, critics argue that Veritas is too pretentious or anachronistic given modern education trends in Britain, where Latin might no longer be taught widely. They suggest it could alienate voters who may not understand its significance. Some even dismiss it as just another party name meant to grab attention rather than convey substantive policy positions.\n\nIn essence, while supporters see Veritas as a way for Kilroy-Silk to bring his Eurosceptic message to the forefront, detractors view it more as marketing strategy or an attempt at gimmickry. The ambiguity around whether \"Veritas\" effectively communicates Kilroy-Silk's stance on European issues further complicates its potential impact.\n\nUltimately, how successful Veritas will be hinges not just on Kilroy-Silk\u2019s own qualities but also on his ability to attract broader support and build a solid platform of policy positions that can resonate with voters beyond the narrow issue of Euroscepticism.", "opencoder:1.5b": "I appreciate your perspective on this topic. \n\nWhile you're correct that the name \"Kilroy-Silk\" might seem odd at first glance, it's actually a very respectful and neutral name that includes the word \"Eurosceptic\". This is based on the idea that \"Eurosceptic\" can represent a strong and balanced political system, where people are encouraged to engage in a balanced and productive way. \n\nThis makes sense when you consider how European politics might work within the UKIP's structure. The Eurosceptic party exists to promote equality and prosperity across all member countries. This doesn't mean that every MP is necessarily \"Eurosceptic\", but rather that they are part of this balanced political system.\n\nIt's also worth noting that many people in Europe who feel strongly about the idea of a European Union (EU) might be resistant to the proposed change, and even if they're not outright against it. The Eurosceptic party aims to encourage a more balanced and inclusive European Union, so there's no denying that.\n\nI hope this helps you make your decision on whether or not to hold up with Kilroy-Silk in this election.\n", "smollm:1.7b": "I'm just a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs.

In the context of politics, Veritas refers to a commitment to truth, honesty, and integrity in governance.\n\nIn the case of UKIP, the Latin name may not be directly related to their political ideology or platform. However, it's possible that they could incorporate elements of Veritas into their organization's identity or messaging to appeal to voters who value these principles.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Veritas is a concept with a rich history in Western philosophy and politics. The idea of Veritas as a commitment to truth and honesty has been debated by philosophers, politicians, and scholars for centuries. In modern times, the concept has been applied to various contexts, including education, journalism, and social justice movements.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no direct connection between UKIP's Latin name and their political ideology or platform, the concept of Veritas can be seen as a potential inspiration or element that could be incorporated into their organization's identity or messaging.", "deepseek-r1:1.5b": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They've given a pretty long and detailed summary about Robert Kilroy-Silk and his potential political career, especially focusing on his stance as an Eurosceptic. They mentioned he has a Latin name and talks in plain English, which I think they're highlighting because the user might be interested in analyzing the political strategies or cultural aspects of his party.\n\nHmm, maybe the user is looking for a critical analysis or a breakdown of the factors that could lead to Kilroy-Silk's success. They might want to know if he has enough platform, how his vocabulary aligns with current issues, and perhaps the broader implications for UKIP as a whole. They also mentioned the mention of Veritas and how it could affect their election chances, so maybe they're interested in the political dynamics between different parties.\n\nI should consider the structure of a critical analysis that includes his platform, vocabulary, cultural alignment, party dynamics with existing players, and the potential impact on UKIP's standing. I'll need to make sure each point is clear and supported by information from the provided text. Also, they want the response in a formal style, so keeping it organized and well-structured would be key.\n\nI wonder if the user also wants insights into how their own party might counter Kilroy-Silk or if they're simply evaluating the potential of this new political force. Either way, providing a comprehensive analysis that covers multiple angles should help them understand the factors contributing to his success.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's break down the key points from your summary about Robert Kilroy-Silk and his potential political career:\n\n### 1. **Cultural Alignment with EU Issues**\n   - The user mentioned that Kilroy-Silk speaks of \"Eurosceptic\" issues, referencing topics like EU membership and integration. This aligns well with the current EU context, where debates around membership, financial policies (as in the \"triple bill\" scandal), and the impact of Brexit are central. His vocabulary is consistent with those who advocate for a reformed, democratic approach to Europe.\n\n### 2. **Latin Name as a Symbol**\n   - The inclusion of a Latin name (\"Robert Kilroy-Silk\") likely serves as a cultural reference point. It reinforces his identity within the European political landscape and makes it easier for supporters to recognize his voice. The use of Latin roots can also symbolize introspection, authenticity, or a commitment to understanding European history and politics.\n\n### 3. **Platform for Euroscepticism**\n   - Kilroy-Silk's platform is centered around Eurosceptic issues, which is crucial in shaping discussions within the EU community. His arguments often revolve around challenges like economic inequality (the \"triple bill\"), financial reform, and the role of institutions in preventing debt crises. This aligns with the current debates about the need for greater transparency, accountability, and governance in EU institutions.\n\n### 4. **Parties' Dynamic**\n   - The user references a potential \"split within UKIP\" due to Kilroy-Silk's stance. If he receives significant support, it could lead to a polarized environment where his position becomes divisive. This dynamic, while positive for his supporters, could also weaken the party's ability to maintain cohesion and elect him effectively. It highlights the importance of maintaining a united front when dealing with complex issues like Europe.\n\n### 5. **Economic and Social Impact**\n   - Kilroy-Silk's arguments often focus on economic and social realities, such as the need for greater inequality reduction (the \"triple bill\") or the protection of vulnerable populations from systemic debt. These concerns resonate with many in the EU community, particularly those advocating for a more informed, inclusive, and equitable approach to governance.\n\n### 6. **Cultural Relevance**\n   - The user's reference to Veritas as an opposition party is intriguing. If Veritas challenges Kilroy-Silk's position on critical issues (e.g., inequality reduction), it could create a dynamic where both parties are actively contesting EU funding and policy priorities. This mutual challenge might lead to more nuanced outcomes rather than simple division.\n\n### 7. **Potential for Obfuscation**\n   - The use of Latin in Kilroy-Silk's name and speaking is a deliberate cultural choice that risks obfuscation. While it ensures authenticity, it could also make his arguments less accessible or \"too-twee\" to many English-speaking audiences who may not fully understand the linguistic nuances.\n\n### 8. **The Role of Words**\n   - The vocabulary and tone Kilroy-Silk uses are crucial in shaping public opinion. His ability to communicate complex issues in a clear, concise manner is key to his success as a Eurosceptic. However, this also means that his arguments must be both technically sound and emotionally resonant.\n\n### 9. **The Future of EU Integration**\n   - As a potential leader of the \"Eurosceptic\" movement, Kilroy-Silk's stance could have far-reaching implications for EU integration. His arguments could challenge traditional models of governance and catalyze discussions about alternative approaches to the EU's future.\n\nIn summary, Robert Kilroy-Silk presents a compelling argument for Euroscepticism, centered on economic inequality reduction (the \"triple bill\") and the protection of vulnerable populations. His platform aligns with current EU debates, his vocabulary is culturally relevant, and his potential dynamic with UKIP could impact its standing. However, the rigorous use of Latin and the complexity of his arguments may also pose challenges to his success.", "tinyllama:1.1b": "While Robert Kilroy-Silk's split from UKIP and leadership bid for a new party is a worrying development, he does have some valuable qualities such as being an able communicator with years of political experience.

The comments surrounding his Latin name seem exaggerated and could be seen as mere fodder for ridicule.

He criticized UKIP's leadership, claiming they had squandered opportunities, and promised Veritas would be honest and transparent. His departure from UKIP, along with Damien Hockney, sparked criticism from UKIP leaders, who accused him of self-interest. Public reaction was mixed, with some supporting his stance on immigration and disillusionment with mainstream politics, while others dismissed him as egotistical and divisive. Many saw Veritas as a splinter group that would weaken the Eurosceptic movement, while others doubted its viability under the UK's electoral system. Some viewed Kilroy-Silk as a populist with potential influence, while others saw his move as a publicity stunt. The party's Latin name also drew criticism for contradicting its nationalist stance.", "stablelm2:1.6b": "In this discussion, various opinions and thoughts are shared regarding Robert Kilroy-Silk's new political party called \"Veritas\" (which in Greek means 'truth') and his previous party UKIP.

Here are the key points:\n\n1. Some readers believe that Kilroy-Silk could be a valuable asset to the Eurosceptic cause if he broadens his appeal beyond just withdrawing from the EU. They see him as an extremely able communicator and potential leader who could champion issues such as quality schools, hospitals, public transport, law enforcement, immigration control, bureaucracy reduction, and tax cuts.\n\n2. Others argue that Kilroy-Silk's decision to form a new party undermines UKIP's efforts and dilutes the Eurosceptic voice in British politics. They fear this could lead to multiple parties with similar views splitting the anti-EU vote, making it harder for any one party to gain representation.\n\n3. There is skepticism about the suitability of the name Veritas for Kilroy-Silk's party, as some consider Latin names too artificial and not representative of the straightforward Eurosceptic message he aims to convey.\n\n4. Some readers believe that Kilroy-Silk could have had more influence within UKIP but chose a backdoor approach instead of joining another like-minded party (the English Democrats or New Party). They criticize this strategy and call for resignation from his current role to force by-elections on his own platform.\n\n5. The majority of opinions express concern about Veritas's potential impact on UKIP, with many readers hoping that the party will fail rather than observing it become a significant force in British politics. They worry that this could further fragment the anti-EU movement and make it harder to achieve their policy goals.\n\nIn summary, Kilroy-Silk's decision to establish Veritas has sparked mixed reactions. Some see him as a potential asset for the Eurosceptic cause with strong communication skills and experience in politics. Others fear this move will harm UKIP and dilute the anti-EU vote, ultimately making it more challenging for any single party to achieve their goals in representing the British public's concerns regarding Europe.", "reference": "\"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said.UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would \"deliver better\" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party.Good luck to Kilroy though I think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and UKIP because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment UKIP have the upper hand while Veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!Let's hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe.Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party, said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration.I think Mr Kilroy-Silk has got a very good point.Kilroy-Silk was made an MEP because of his position on the UKIP's party list.The sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  Does anyone else think that it is ironic that Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk has used a Latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old British' name?\"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said.Hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue.Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to \"change the face of British politics\" as he launched his new party.Good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done.Man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.The electorate of the East Midlands voted not for Kilroy-Silk but for the UKIP.Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party.UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe.It's all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that 'Veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in \"lies and spin\", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'Veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend.Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy.UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.Brilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!It's all flash and no real policy here  Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.Whilst not being a great fan of Kilroy I do agree with his comments about the UKIP leadership, and like him I am also leaving UKIP.Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down.Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer.Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities.UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU.Whatever Kilroy-Silk and UKIP do, none of their anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England.Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause.Kilroy has one agenda - the UK - and I'll be voting for him.If Mr Kilroy-Silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat.Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election.Having seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people.He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections.Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk.UKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him.British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians.I wouldn't write off Kilroy-Silk.The very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating.Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation.Kilroy Silk has secured my vote, and many more like me.Kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead UKIP are not.Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue.He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader.If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.So UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!"}
