Duchy officials, who will appear before the committee on Monday, are only responsible for generating money. The Duchy of Lancaster provides the Queen's private income, while the Duchy of Cornwall provides Prince Charles' annual income. The Duchy of Cornwall is a 140,000-acre estate across 25 counties, and also includes residential properties, shops, offices, stocks and shares. It was set up in 1337 by King Edward III to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. It covers the cost of the prince's public and private life - neither Charles, nor William and Harry, receive taxpayers' money from the Civil List. However, the Prince of Wales did receive over \u00a34m from government departments and grants-in-aid in 2003-4. The duchy last year generated almost \u00a312m.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst paragraph: MPs are assigning quiz aides to investigate income generated by UK MPs for the Queen and Prince of Wales. The senior officials from both bodies will be questioned by MPs. Interesting angle on public-private splitting, maybe targeting some reforms or something?\n\nSecond paragraph: They mention a specific group from the Duchy of Cornwall being questioned. Specifically about Peter Hunt saying they aren't responsible for how money is spent, maybe? But some of them are accountable for generating income. That makes sense because the Duchy deals with their own taxes and affairs.\n\nThird part: The Duchy of Lancaster provides income to the Queen, while the Duchy of Cornwall provides income to Prince Charles each year. Their property details are provided\u2014140,000 acres in 25 counties, including stuff like residential homes, shops, offices, stocks, and shares. This sounds like a big estate that's been around for over a thousand years.\n\nFourth paragraph: The Duchy of Cornwall was set up by King Edward III to provide income for the next king (Charles II) after his death. They're responsible for taxes from the government and grants-in-aid in 2003-4, so they definitely handle money flow properly. They made over \u00a312 million last year.\n\nFifth paragraph: The Prince of Wales has paid income tax since 1993 at 40%. That's a significant figure; maybe he's trying to show that the system is working or needs reforming? He also received money from various sources, which isn't directly related to public-private splitting but shows his financial stability.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to highlight the main points: MPs are questioning officials for income generation related to royal taxes, a specific group in Cornwall will be questioned, their responsibilities and how they manage finances. Also, some responsible, others not so much, given public interest issues.\n</think>\n\n MPs are assigning quiz aides to investigate income generated by UK MPs for the Queen and Prince of Wales, generating private income for them.
