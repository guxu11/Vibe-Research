{"raw_text": "Kennedy begins pre-election tour\n \n Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has begun a week-long tour to persuade voters they are the \"real opposition\".\n \n Mr Kennedy is visiting constituencies in Somerset and Hampshire on Monday - rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the Conservatives. Later he will visit places, such as Liverpool, where Labour is targeted. Labour say a Lib Dem vote could \"let the Tories in\", while the Tories say the Lib Dems would mean \"higher taxes, soft crime laws, more power to Europe\". Mr Kennedy's tour comes as he, Labour leader Tony Blair and Conservative leader Michael Howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next General Election, widely expected to be held on 5 May. On Tuesday Mr Kennedy will visit Leicester South, where Lib Dem MP Parmjit Singh Gill overturned a big Labour majority to win the seat in last year's by-election.\n \n Stops in Shrewsbury, North Dorset, Liverpool, Manchester, Basingstoke and west London are planned for later in the week. The Liberal Democrats say in the northern cities, the race is between them and Labour, while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the Tories. Speaking to the BBC's Westminster Hour on Sunday, Mr Kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 May - would be much more unpredictable than any others in \"recent experience\". Asked whether it was realistic to assume the Liberal Democrats could win the general election, he said: \"There's no limit to the ambitions we have as a party. \"But we have got to be responsible, we have got to be credible, we have got to demonstrate to people that we are up to that task.\"\n \n Mr Kennedy said the British public felt let down by Labour on issues from Iraq to top-up fees and the Conservatives were not \"asking the critical questions\". And he said people were \"highly sceptical\" about Labour and Conservative promises on tax. But he brushed off Labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the Tories in \"by the back door\". \"If you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections, the Liberal Democrats have demonstrated that, not only can we leapfrog the Conservatives where we start in a third place position, but we can go on to defeat the government. \"That's going to be the story, I think, of this coming general election.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Charles Kennedy begins a week-long tour to persuade voters he is the \"real opposition\" and visit key constituencies such as Somerset and Hampshire where his party hopes to gain from the Conservatives.\n\nHe will also visit Liverpool where Labour is targeted, and Basingstoke and west London.

Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nFirst, it starts by mentioning that Kennedy is starting a week-long tour to get voters in the form of \"the real opposition.\" He's leading into an upcoming election on May 5th, where both major parties are expected to be very active.\n\nHe visits constituencies in Somerset and Hampshire, which are rural areas. There he hopes to make gains from the Conservatives. Then later on, he plans to visit places like Liverpool, Labour's stronghold, targeting them. Labour is expecting their vote to \"let the Tories in,\" while the Tories say it would mean higher taxes, soft crime laws, and more power to Europe.\n\nHe mentions some specific stops: Shrewsbury, Leicester South, Manchester, Basingstoke, and parts of West London. He also refers to northern cities where both parties are competing with Labour versus them, and southern cities focused on the Conservatives.\n\nMr Kennedy is addressing the BBC's Westminster Hour, stating that the upcoming election is likely unpredictable compared to past ones. He mentions Labour has been taking issues from Iraq, top-up fees, etc., while Conservatives haven't asked critical questions. He says people are skeptical about Labour's promises on taxes but seems confident in his own campaign.\n\nHe also criticizes previous by-elections where Democrats could leapfrog the Conservatives and secure a government victory. He thinks this election will be a continuation of that trend. He's optimistic for the Liberal Democrats to win and sees their strategy to challenge the Conservatives effectively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key points are:\n- Kennedy starts a tour on Monday in rural areas to make gains.\n- Targets Liverpool later with Labour, but not focused on major elections yet.\n- Talks about how election being unpredictable.\n- Criticizes Labour's tax issues and others' previous successes as potential stepping stones.\n- Emphasizes his own campaign and optimism for victory.\n\nI should condense all this into a concise summary without any extra details or explanations. Make sure to include main ideas, locations, themes, and quotes from Kennedy during his speech.\n</think>\n\nCharles Kennedy begins a pre-election tour on Monday in rural areas like Somerset and Hampshire to make gains from the Conservatives, targeting Liverpool later.
