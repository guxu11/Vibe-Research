But he argued: \"We mustn't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. \"Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. \"With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people's lives as they grow older. \"I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research.
