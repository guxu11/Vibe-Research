{"raw_text": "Clarke plans migrant point scheme\n \n Anyone planning to move to the UK will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said.\n \n He is proposing a points system similar to Australia's but would avoid the quota system planned by the Tories. Mr Clarke, who will unveil his plans on Monday, said economic migration helped the UK but \"needed proper policing\". The Lib Dems say they will look at his plans, but Tory Liam Fox said his party offered a \"clear choice\" on the issue. The Conservative Party Co-Chairman said the British electorate had a choice between a Labour government that had \"done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit\" on immigration and a Tory one that would impose quotas.\n \n The home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the UK to have their fingerprints taken, to \"ensure we can know everybody who is in the country\". Speaking on BBC One's Breakfast with Frost, he said \"economic migrants are of great value to this country\", but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a \"burden on society\". He said: \"We will establish a system ... which looks at the skills, talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country, and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.\"\n \n The home secretary, whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on Monday, also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry. \"The issue of who does come into this country, and whether they are entitled to be in this country, who does settle here, how we have border controls, is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate,\" he said. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"Whilst it is good that Labour has rejected the Tory idea of quotas on asylum, the jury is still out on the Home Office's ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.\"\n \n Mr Howard has said Britain should take its fair share of the world's \"genuine refugees\". But he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain's generosity. Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, called on Mr Clarke to denounce the suggestion Britain's hospitality was being tested by immigration. \"Tell that to the 44,000 doctors in the NHS and the 70,000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means,\" he said. \"Ditto the teachers, from South Africa, Australia, Jamaica, who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools.\" The Refugee Council said Mr Howard's proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the UK.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Home Secretary Charles Clarke plans to introduce a points-based system for migrant entry to the UK, aiming to prioritize skilled workers over others.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the text is from the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, talking about his plans for the migrant points system in the UK. He mentions that everyone would have to pass a test to contribute to the country. \n\nHe compares it to Australia but avoids the quota system used by the Tories. Instead of a fixed number (quota), he's suggesting something more flexible. He emphasizes that economic migration is good for the UK, but proper policing is needed to prevent someone from becoming a burden on society. That part seems crucial because it adds a moral and regulatory element.\n\n Clarke outlines the points system: everyone gets a certain number of points, and those who come to the UK are evaluated based on their skills, talents, and whether they can contribute to the economy. He wants this system to ensure transparency\u2014by taking fingerprints or something similar\u2014to verify identities. This part shows how he's making it easier for people to come to the UK while maintaining trust.\n\nThe text also mentions his blueprint for immigration and asylum over five years is expected. Clarke said it will be published, and he was critical of claims that the debate encouraged bigotry. He focused on the issues rather than just who does what. \n\nHe criticized policies like quotas on asylum, saying they might not work if compared to other countries or workplaces. For example, the Home Office wants to avoid imposing strict limits but could end up discriminating unfairly. He also mentioned Trevor Phillips calling for Britain to offer more safe shelters in case of persecution. The Refugee Council is worried that this would make Britain too lenient.\n\nI need to capture these key points: Clarke's plan using a flexible point system, avoiding the quota system, promoting proper policing, ensuring transparency with identity checks, his focus on issues over who does what, criticism of some immigration policies like quotas, and calls for better asylum options. I should avoid any unnecessary details and keep it straightforward.\n\nNow, putting this all together into a concise summary without explanations or formatting.\n</think>\n\nClarke proposes a flexible points system to assess migrants in the UK, avoiding the fixed quota system but ensuring proper policing.
