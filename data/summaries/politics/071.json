They set annual targets of 8,000 applications per officer, which translates to about 40 applications a day or one every 11 minutes. MPs are interested in whether UK visa holders stay for their full length or disappear into the black market.\n\nEdward Leigh from the committee said there's a tension between quick processing and proper control. He mentions that entry clearance staff have expected less time per application, maybe too little to look closely at supporting documents.\n\nThen, the report discusses a scandal with Immigration Minister Beverley Hughes resigning. It found that about 7,000 people entered the UK under the business visa scheme from Romania and Bulgaria. Leigh noted the Home Office was wrong in dismissing staff's concerns earlier. They tightened the system since the investigation found more people had entered without proper support.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all these points: the processing time, the criticism of efficiency, the target numbers, the MPs' interest in visa status, and the findings about the Romanian and Bulgarian scam.\n\nLet me structure this into a concise summary.\n</think>\n\nVisa processing is expected to take 11 minutes per application, with MPs criticizing staff for being rushed rather than thoroughly examining documents. A report found annual targets of 8,000 applications, equating to 40 per day or one every 11 minutes. MPs want to know if UK visa holders stay long or vanish in the black market.
