Let me read through it first.\n\nThe text starts by saying that MPs criticized the system for not giving divorced parents access to their children. It points out that the legal system sometimes disadvantages parents who are divorced because of the issues with the court system. They mentioned that former partners might exploit delays in the system, which would cause them to gain access.\n\nThen, it brings up the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee saying that parents could use court procedures as a last resort if they didn't want to deal with the system directly. But they said courts shouldn't be used unless absolutely necessary, and that their orders should be enforced more strictly.\n\nBut there's a rejection by some groups who say that there should be a presumption of equal access because the child's needs are so important. The MPs argue against this idea, saying it's unfair to have one party have more access than another based on the child's interests alone.\n\nThey mention that the system has been reformed over time but faced many criticisms, especially in contested cases. They called the inquiry (which seems like a legal process) complex and emotional. The chairman of the committee said the five-month inquiry was too focused on court work without considering mediation or negotiation because it wasn't effective in resolving issues.\n\nThe conclusion is that the court system should be the last resort, not the first one used. This would help reduce delays for children. They emphasize the need to make these changes to ensure better access and support for children regardless of their parents' background.\n\nSo, putting this all together, I need a concise summary. I'll outline each main point: MPs criticizing divorce parents access, concerns about legal system bias against certain parents, the committee's stance on using courts as last resort, the emphasis on equal access, criticism from groups opposing equal access, and the conclusion that court use is the last resort.\n\nI should make sure to mention key elements like arbitrary templates of child welfare, specific cases with contested outcomes, the need for flexible handling through non-resident parents contacting children, and reducing delays in accessing children's lives.\n\nLet me try to put this into a concise summary without using any markdown or explanations.\n</think>\n\n MPs criticized the system for not giving divorced parents access to their children. They argued that courts often unfairly disadvantage parents based on child needs. The Constitutional Select Committee suggested courts as a last resort, but emphasized strict enforcement. However, some groups rejected the idea of equal access to children and parents. MPs highlighted the need for flexible handling, especially in contested cases, where non-resident parents should contact children while allowing for safety concerns.

Delays in court proceedings and a lack of enforcement of court orders have resulted in \"new status quo arrangements\" for children becoming established by default, according to the MPs' report.

The select committee proposes that family courts should specifically take into account the importance of maintaining the relationship between the child and both parents in contested cases.

The committee also called for the law to require family courts to consider the importance of maintaining a child's relationship with their non-resident parent in contested cases, while still leaving room for flexibility in handling safety concerns.
