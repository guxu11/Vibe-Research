Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, it says that a deal is bringing Turkey closer to EU membership, which is important for world peace because of the \"fundamental importance\" Tony Blair mentioned. Then Tony Blair said that this deal also helped prevent a clash between Muslims and Christians as people pointed out, calling it \"wrong.\" He added that this was a historic British objective.\n\nNext, Michael Howard, the Tory leader, argued that the deal settled any doubt about the EU being anti-Islamic. He suggested that the EU constitution wasn't set up to take a country as big as Turkey, which was controversial because Turkey has its own leadership and hasn't been seen as fully involved with the EU yet.\n\nTurkey's involvement in the EU could be an important bridge between Europe and the rest of the world since it's so large. But Howard said the EU doesn't design for such major countries, which might make some people uncomfortable or suspicious. Tony Blair, despite being a strong advocate, had controversy around Turkey joining the EU.\n\nThe deal to open talks with Ankara came because the EU wanted Turkey to recognize Cyprus, an EU member. However, Turkey's position on recognizing Cyprus was strict; it didn't want to join the EU just yet, calling it a red line. It would take up to 15 years to get into membership, and even then, Turkey might have to restrict migration by its citizens.\n\nThe EU is also starting talks with Croatia in April 2005, but these talks can only begin if both Croatia and the former Yugoslavia cooperate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal. The deal's importance is discussed among Blair, Howard, and other experts, showing that Turkey's role could have a significant impact on the world's peace.\n\nI think I need to make sure all key points are covered concisely without adding extra details. So, summarizing each main point: turkey closer to eu membership (importance for world peace), deal preventing muhurabah between mukabs and Christians, EU constitution not designed for such large countries, Turkey's role as a bridge, EU's demand for Cyprus recognition, time frame for Turkey joining, and the EU's progress with Croatia.\n\nI should structure this into a few clear paragraphs or sentences without any extra fluff. Let me check if I missed any important details that were highlighted in the original text.\n</think>\n\nA deal has brought Turkey closer to EU membership, crucial for world peace due to its \"fundamental importance\" from Tony Blair. The deal also avoided claims of muhurabah between Muslims and Christians. It represents a historic British objective.

Turkey's role as an EU bridge is significant, but debates suggest the EU's constitution isn't tailored for such nations.\n\nThe deal opened formal talks with Ankara, partly addressing the EU's demand to recognize Cyprus. Turkey initially refused recognition, marking it a \"red line.\" Membership would take up to 15 years, and Turkey might restrict migration by its citizens.
