{"raw_text": "Butler launches attack on Blair\n \n Former civil service chief Lord Butler has criticised the way Tony Blair's government operates, accusing it of being obsessed with headlines.\n \n He also attacked the way the Iraq war was \"sold\" to the public, with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out. Tory leader Michael Howard said Lord Butler had given the \"most damaging testimony\" he could remember. But Downing Street said Mr Blair should be judged by results not his style.\n \n Lord Butler said Mr Blair bypassed the Cabinet and relied instead on small, informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. The prime minister's official spokesman said the Cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. But he added: \"You cannot, in a modern government, take every decision in Cabinet. It's just not possible.\"\n \n Lord Butler said the government had too much freedom to \"bring in bad Bills\" and \"to do whatever it likes\" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. The former cabinet secretary said in an interview with The Spectator magazine: \"I would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling, there is too much central control and there is too little of what I would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments.\" Mr Howard described Lord Butler's intervention as \"very important\". \"This is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the Blair government. \"It is certainly the most damaging testimony I can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position.\"\n \n Lord Butler's report earlier this year into Iraq intelligence said the government's September 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was \"very thin\". The reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers' case for war, Lord Butler said in his Spectator interview, which was conducted by the magazine's editor, Conservative MP Boris Johnson. He said: \"When civil servants give material to ministers, they say these are the conclusions we've drawn, but we've got to tell you the evidence we've got is pretty thin. \"Similarly, if you are giving something to the United Nations and the country you should warn them.\"\n \n Asked why he thought the warnings were not there Lord Butler said: \"One has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. The purpose of the dossier was to persuade the British why the government thought Iraq was a very serious threat.\"\n \n When asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole, he replied: \"Well. I think we are a country where we suffer very badly from Parliament not having sufficient control over the executive, and that is a very grave flaw. \"We should be breaking away from the party whip. The executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad Bills, a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow. \"All that is part of what is bad government in this country.\" Lord Butler's assessment was backed by his predecessor as Cabinet Secretary, Lord Armstrong. Lord Armstrong told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"I agree ... there doesn't appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect.\" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Menzies Campbell said he thought Lord Butler's comments were \"well justified\" and Mr Blair's style of leadership was \"corrosive of the whole system of government\". But Labour former minister Jack Cunningham accused Lord Butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming Labour administration, when he was cabinet secretary. Mr Cunningham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Taken together, Robin Butler's comments are partial, inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the Labour government.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Lord Butler criticizes Tony Blair's government for being obsessed with headlines and relying too heavily on informal groups of advisers. He accuses them of bypassing the Cabinet to make decisions and doing whatever they want without consulting others. Butler also says that the government has too much freedom to bring in \"bad Bills\" and does not have sufficient control over the executive.\n\nLord Butler's report into Iraq intelligence criticized how it did not make clear warnings about Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological weapons stockpiles, saying this was due to weakening ministers' cases for war. The report suggested that civil servants should warn parliament and the country if they disagree with government decisions.\n\nButler says that he believes the country suffers from a lack of control over the executive and thinks it is bad governance when the executive is too free to bring in bad laws and regulations. His assessment was backed by his predecessor as Cabinet Secretary, Lord Armstrong, who agreed that there is not enough collective political judgment on decision-making.\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Menzies Campbell believes Butler's comments are well justified, but Labour former minister Jack Cunningham thinks they are biased against the Labour government.", "llama3.2:3b": "Lord Butler criticizes Tony Blair's government for being obsessed with headlines and bypassing Cabinet to make decisions.

Lord Butler attributes that failure to him not having consulted enough Cabinet members. Lord Blair says he relies too much on the advice of political appointees and does not consider his style as an insider at the government's heart, adding that he sees himself as someone who was \"an insider at the very heart of the Blair government\". In his interview with The Spectator magazine, Lord Butler accused Blair of being too free to bring in \"bad Bills\" without ministerial backing and also over-emphasising its central control. Blair dismisses the reports into Iraq intelligence made by Lord Butler, accusing him of giving too thin a dossier on Saddam Hussein's weapons programme. He says that civil servants give them conclusions but must warn about their evidence being weak. Lord Armstrong, former cabinet secretary to Blair, thinks the government has been underfunded and is dominated by political appointees. The former prime minister, David Miliband, criticises Lord Butler for basing his comments on a few months in office rather than what he saw as the whole period of Blair's administration. He accuses Lord Butler of not considering the impact of his interventions and instead focusing only on headlines.", "qwen2.5:1.5b": "Former civil service chief Lord Butler criticizes Tony Blair's government for being obsessed with headlines, ignoring important intelligence warnings.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nAlright, Butler is former civil service chief, and he's criticizing Blair for his government being obsessed with headlines. He also talks about Iraq's war not giving enough intelligence because Blair's report said the dossier wasn't clear on Saddam Hussein having chemical-biological weapons. \n\nHe mentions that Blair relied too much on small groups and political appointees instead of Cabinet. There were some quotes from people, but I need to make sure I capture key points.\n\nBlair was known for his style where he bypassed the Cabinet and used informal groups. Butler said this isn't fair because you can't take every decision in the Cabinet; it's just not possible anymore. He compared modern governments being too focused on selling things and letting bad bills flow, while also lacking reasoned deliberation.\n\nBlair's report didn't make clear intelligence about Hussein's weapons, which is a big issue. Then he talks about how Blair's country is poorly governed. They have problems with Parliament controlling the executive, which makes leadership harsher.\n\nBlair's critics, like Mr. Howard and Menzies Campbell, say Butler's comments are biased against Labour and that his style is worse than what others are doing. Cunningham thinks these quotes from Butler are unreliable because they're just a part of his history, not a full picture.\n\nI need to condense all this into a concise summary without adding explanations or any formatting. Just plain text showing the main points: Butler's criticism of Blair's government structure and approach to intelligence, including specific quotes from others, and how Blair's country seems underwhelming in governance.\n</think>\n\nLord Butler criticized Tony Blair for his government's obsession with headlines and reliance on small groups rather than Cabinet meetings. He argued Blair oversaw important issues without the cabinet's expertise, saying decisions can't be fully brought into play now. Blair's report on Iraq's intelligence was insufficient, highlighting weak ministerial conclusions due to limited evidence. Butler also criticized Blair's perceived lack of informed collective judgment and the excessive focus on political appointees, suggesting modern governments should balance selling with reasoned deliberation. He emphasized that Blair's country lacks sufficient control over the executive by many, while others like Armstrong and Campbell call his style corrupt.

He believes that the executive is too free to bring in bad Bill, doing whatever it likes, and lacking control over Parliament to make informed decisions. This, he argues, has led to a culture of \"sold\" (headlines) rather than \"reliable\" (consequences). As the previous Cabinet Secretary, Lord Armstrong also supports this argument by stating that decision-making is not properly informed in the government, but instead relies on small informal groups.
