But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now. \"ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society,\" he said.

Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as \"deeply flawed\" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about ID cards than his predecessors. \"Wouldn't this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place?\" he asked.
