Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra \u00a30.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation.

Let me read through the provided query carefully.\n\nFirst, the UK has pledged \u00a31bn for a vaccine effort over 15 years. The speech mentions the Millennium Declaration goals, which include halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Chancellor Gordon Brown is speaking at a joint event with IUDP and DEFIS, welcoming news about Bill Gates' Foundation and Norway joining Gavi to invest an extra \u00a30.53bn.\n\nThe text talks about how Gavi plans to apply the IFF principles for immunisation, which would allow donors to make long-term financial commitments acting as collateral for additional funds. If Gavi increases funding by \u00a34bn over 10 years, that could save 5 million lives each year and continue saving them afterward.\n\nCampaign groups like Friends of the Earth and World Development Movement are concerned about the UK's free trade policies hindering poverty alleviation. They argue that free trade and privatisation on developing countries can push people deeper into poverty rather than lifting them out.\n\nBrown is against continued free trade, stating that neo-liberal policies prevent more from entering the economy without support, leading to increased poverty.\n\nSo, I need to condense all this information into a clear summary without adding any explanations or formatting. The focus should be on the main points: UK's \u00a31bn commitment, Gavi's plan, potential savings if funding is extended, campaign concerns about free trade, and Brown's opposition.\n</think>\n\nUK has pledged \u00a31 billion for vaccine efforts over 15 years, aimed at addressing poverty and child mortality as part of the Millennium Declaration goals.
