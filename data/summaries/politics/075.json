Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the provided text. It seems to be about Boris Johnson's remarks regarding Jewish journalists and London mayor Ken Livingstone. There are mentions of his apology, his stance on racism, and his thoughts on Labour's approach towards Jewish voters.\n\nThe user wants a concise summary preserving key ideas. They specified that I should only output plain text without explanations or any formatting beyond the summary itself. That means I have to be accurate and include all essential details without adding anything else.\n\nLooking at the first sentence: \"Boris opposes mayor apology.\" I should make sure this is included as it's a main point. Then, the second part talks about Ken Livingstone and Tony Blair's involvement in a previous matter. Johnson agreed with Livingstone to suggest a \"concentration camp guard\" role for a Jewish reporter.\n\nMr. Livingstone later said he was \"standing by,\" implying he remained neutral on that topic. The PM now plans to address Livingstone, possibly apologizing after the report.\n\nThen there's more about Johnson's past apology and his frustration over previous statements. He criticized Blair for getting involved in the issue, suggesting a shift in opinion towards Labour.\n\nFinally, Johnson mentions the reasons behind his words regarding antisemitism, referencing old accounts of his unpolite remarks to readers who were disillusioned with Muslims. This adds depth to his stance on the topic.\n\nI need to condense all this into a coherent summary. Make sure to capture each main point: Johnson's refusal to apologize for an article about Liverpudlians, Livingstone's statement about being \"standing by,\" the PM's clarification, Johnson's personal comments on antisemitism, and his current approach regarding Livingstone.\n\nI should keep it clear and straightforward, avoiding any unnecessary details.
