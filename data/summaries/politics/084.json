The union says it is concerned about pensions, sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. Last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and Jobcentres across the UK would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first sentence mentions that the government's job cuts are a \"false economy\" affecting public sector reforms. It says 71,000 jobs will be lost, which is significant because that's 3% of all jobs in Britain. The report also notes they're already planning strikes over those cuts for one day.\n\nThe union members have voted to strike because the government is cutting tens of thousands of jobs. They said this could hamper reforms and result in \"less than 6%\" of \u00a322 billion savings, which is much less than what the government wanted. The union leader, Brendan Barber, said costs would outweigh benefits and that public services are improving but job cuts might look like a false economy.\n\nBarber also mentions the strike is the biggest since 1993, affecting sectors like civil service jobs, benefit agencies, pensions, etc. They're concerned about issues like pensions, sick pay, relocation, and job cuts in areas like passports, museums, health inspections, etc.\n\nSo the key points are: TUC's report says they'll cut 71k jobs; this is a \"false economy\"; it affects reforms; the strike has already started; union fears about pensions, sick pay; other sectors affected include health and safety inspections. The number of civil servants rose to over 520k by April, so this is a big change.\n\nI need to make sure I capture all these points concisely without explanations or formatting.\n</think>\n\nThe TUC report warns that cutting 71,000 jobs will be a \"false economy\" affecting public sector reforms. Public and Commercial Services union members have already voted to strike for one day over the cuts on November 5th. The report estimates the savings would fall short of what was hoped for, with only about 6% of \u00a322 billion saved. General Secretary Brendan Barber warned that costs could outweigh benefits, calling it a false economy as job cuts might seem like savings but instead could harm public services.\n\nThe strike is the biggest since 1993, affecting sectors like civil service jobs, benefit agencies, pensions, and more.
