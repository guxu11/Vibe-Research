Let me read through it carefully first.\n\nThe text starts by saying that the Conservative campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned Michael Howard about a potential loss in the next election. I remember that defeatism is when you try to make people think you're losing, which can be bad for your reputation. So if someone denies defeatism, maybe they believe the party isn't really doing their best.\n\nNext, the Times on Monday reported that Lynton Crosby told Michael Howard to focus on increasing the Tories' presence in the Commons by 25 to 30 seats. I know the MPs vote for their seats, so this is about getting more of them. But Crosby said he never had a conversation about it before and doesn't agree with the idea. He later admitted that the report was false.\n\nThen, Howard appointed him as head of elections last October, aiming to distract people from real issues. The statement he made highlighted the party's progress on tax and immigration but compared Labour's focus to distractions away from real problems. This could show that while the campaign director is focused on his own issues, there might be underlying issues with the party.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the expert is saying the Conservative Party isn't doing enough for its issues\u2014taxes and immigration. They need more seats in parliament but aren't preparing to do so. The report about Howard's election strategy was fake, which could undermine his efforts and create mistrust among supporters.\n\nI should make sure the summary captures all key points: the expert denying defeatism, the report about Howard's election focus being fake, and the underlying issues with the party on tax and immigration.\n</think>\n\nTory experts deny defeatism over Conservative campaign director's claims.
