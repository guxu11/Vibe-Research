{"raw_text": "Election deal faltered over Heath role\n \n The Tories failed to hold onto power in 1974 after Liberals demanded Sir Edward Heath quit in return for co-operation.\n \n Documents released after 30 years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic February general election. Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government. But it partly collapsed over the Conservative leader's own role, prompting the Queen to ask Harold Wilson to form a Labour government. The February 1974 general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control. Sir Edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis, a miners' strike and the subsequent three-day week. Labour emerged with the most seats - but its 301 MPs were 17 short of the number Mr Wilson needed to form a majority.\n \n Sir Edward, who had received more votes but had fewer MPs, believed he had the authority to remain at Number 10 providing the 14 Liberal MPs would support his government. He said the Liberals could keep out Labour in three ways: lend ad hoc support to his minority government, help draw up the government's programme, or have up to three Cabinet members in a coalition with the Conservatives. According to the documents released at the National Archives, the \"friendly and easy\" first meeting indicated that both Sir Edward and Mr Thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal. Mr Thorpe was in high spirits, having just led his party to a historic jump in support. He also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties. But Sir Edward said that was impossible because the Labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a Conservative-Liberal pact.\n \n Hours later Sir Edward's hopes of a deal unravelled as Mr Thorpe's colleagues refused to support him. \"Jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally,\" reads a telephone memo for Mr Heath.\n \n \"They feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister. \"Asked if this was his own view he said - no it was not, I am very close to Ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve - it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult.\" The following day, the stickling points had clearly become two-fold: Mr Thorpe's colleagues wanted electoral reform and Sir Edward's resignation. Mr Thorpe told Sir Edward: \"I am sorry this is obviously hell - a nightmare on stilts for you. \"Somehow I personally hope that we can work something out.\"\n \n Four hours later, Sir Edward called the Liberal leader back to Downing Street in a last attempt at a deal. The minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated. \"The PM said he was bound to tell Mr Thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister. Mr Thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime minister's colleagues.\" Documents show that Sir Edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a Labour-led coalition. But he already knew Mr Wilson would not form a coalition with either the Liberals or the Conservatives because of the opposition of the Labour left. Within hours of his final talks with Mr Thorpe, Sir Edward told the nation he was resigning and the Queen invited Mr Wilson to form a new minority government.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Tories failed to hold onto power in 1974 due to election deal between Heath and Liberals.\n\nLiberal leader Jeremy Thorpe offered to form a coalition government if Conservatives co-operated.\nHeath declined, believing he had authority to remain at Number 10 without Liberal support.\n\nThorpe's colleagues initially refused to support Heath as prime minister, citing concerns about his leadership style.\nLater that day, Thorpe told Heath: \"I am sorry this is obviously hell - a nightmare on stilts for you.\"\nFour hours later, Thorpe returned to Downing Street in a last attempt at a deal, but it was clear the negotiations would not proceed.", "llama3.2:3b": "The Tories failed to hold power in 1974 after Liberals demanded Sir Edward Heath quit in return for co-operation.

The document reveals that after the Conservatives won their mandate, they formed a hung parliament with no party in overall control. In response, the Liberal leader, Mr. Thorpe, expressed willingness to cooperate under two conditions: he wanted Labour to support him and a grand coalition of all three parties was proposed. However, Sir Edward Heath, who had received more votes but fewer MPs than his colleagues, believed he could maintain himself if the Liberals remained in power by lending ad hoc support or helping draft the government's plan. On February 1974, the Conservatives held an election with a hung parliament and Labour emerged as the majority party, needing three-party support to form a majority. Sir Edward Heath felt betrayed by the Conservatives who refused to withdraw his mandate, while Mr. Thorpe was reluctant to agree to a coalition government under Sir Edward's leadership without any of his allies supporting him.

It mentions documents from 30 years ago show what happened then\u2014like a hung parliament and the emergence of Labour winning but with some issues.\n\nThere's more details on Edward's role: he was given a fresh mandate because of the economic crisis, strikes, etc. He believed he could stay at Number 10 even though there were no party controls in power. His plan included supporting his minority government, helping set up their government's program, or having up to three Conservatives with them.\n\nThen Thorpe, the Liberal leader, was hopeful but got scared when he tried to form a deal. He suggested a coalition but Sir Edward opposed that, thinking it wasn't possible because Labour was against him.\n\nThere were some key points about how documents revealed the issues and what happened during their meetings, like Sir Edward trying again but failing. Eventually, Sir Edward saw an opportunity to resign or get out of the deal, which led to the Queen inviting Harold Wilson to form a new minority government.\n\nI need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure I include the main events: the failure of the deal, documents from 30 years ago, Edward's role and his support for forming Number 10, Thorpe's attempts, conflict between them, Sir Edward's resistance, meeting with Thorpe again, and the eventual outcome of the deal being defeated.\n</think>\n\nThe 1974 election deal between the Tories and Liberals failed due to Edward Heath's resignation in exchange for mutual co-operation.
