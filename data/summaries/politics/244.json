It was down to the Higher Education Funding Council and the research councils to decide on universities' research allocations. British law is open to the cloning of human embryos to create stem cells, master cells that can develop into all the body's tissue types. This cloning activity is not permitted for reproductive purposes - only for research into new disease treatments. However, it is controversial because it involves the destruction of embryos.\n \n Professor Rothwell, who is also vice-president of research at Manchester University, told the Times Higher Education Supplement it would worry her \"a great deal\" if ministers were anti-stem cell.

The text is about research fears related to Ruth Kelly's religious views and their potential impact on scientific research. \n\nThe first paragraph mentions concerns expressed by scientists that Kelly's Catholic views might hinder research, particularly since she's pro-life and opposed embryo research.

There's also mention of cloning embryos for stem cells or master cells and that this is against reproductive purposes, though controversially.\n\nAnother section talks about professors' opinions in The Times Higher Education Supplement. Professor Rothwell expresses regret if ministers opposed stem cell research and criticizes the US situation with religious groups opposing it. However, the user's perspective from Manchester University shows a lack of concern, while others worry about the impact on fertility education policies.\n\nLastly, Anne Weyman emphasizes the importance of curriculum in schools, urging the government to maintain commitment to teenage pregnancy strategies and promote science education without favoring stem cell research.\n\nPutting this all together, I need to condense the main points into a clear summary.
