Father-of-two Mr Mousa, 28, a hotel receptionist, was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in Basra in September 2003.

Both sides were granted permission to appeal.\n \n Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said: \"Obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. I would point out, however, that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority. \"I can't say anything further for obvious reasons. The MoD are considering whether to appeal.\" But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : \"Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: 'If there's a case to answer, let's have it out.
