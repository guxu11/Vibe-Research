However those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland.\n \n On Thursday, senior law lord Lord Bingham said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\".

Lord Hoffmann said: \"The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these.\" But Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, the one law lord to oppose the appeal, said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression.\n \n In a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.

The key elements seem to be:\n\n1. UK government is considering holding foreign terrorism suspects without trial or charge.\n2. The House of Lords made an eight-to-one ruling in favor of appeals by nine detainees.\n3. These men will stay behind bars while ministers decide how to react.\n4. The ruling violates European human rights laws, preventing indefinite detention based on nationality or immigration.\n5. Belmarsh prison is referred to as \"Britain's Guantanamo Bay.\"\n6.
