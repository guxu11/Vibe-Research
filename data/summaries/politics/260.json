{"raw_text": "Labour seeks to quell feud talk\n \n Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\n \n Mr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\n \n The event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\n \n He refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\n \n Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\n \n The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\n \n On Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Labour's leadership launched campaign posters after MPs criticized Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift. \n\nMPs warned that feuding could jeopardize election hopes due to disputes between the two.\n\nThe Labour Party was joined by John Prescott and Alan Milburn at a campaign launch, marking Mr Brown's first public appearance since taking charge of election planning from Mr Blair.\n\nMr Brown denied claims he did not trust Mr Blair, saying \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy\".\n\nLabour posters highlight low inflation, unemployment, and mortgage rates as reasons for optimism. \n\nThe Conservative Party criticized the photo call as a lack of unity, with Liam Fox calling it the worst acting since Prisoner Cell Block H.\n\nMPs were also critical of Labour's past actions, including raising taxes 66 times and slow economic growth.", "llama3.2:3b": "Labour's leadership showed unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticized Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.

Let me read through it carefully and figure out what's important.\n\nThe first paragraph talks about Labour seeking to quell a feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They did something at a campaign poster launch after the MPs criticized them for their rift. That seems like a key point because it shows their union efforts after criticism.\n\nNext, John Prescott and Alan Milburn joined the event. Milburn was previously in charge of election planning under Blair, but now he's in charge of election planning with Brown. It mentions a private meeting where loyal MPs warn about feuding hoping for election hope. That's another important detail\u2014how the feud might impact their chances.\n\nThen there's a new book charting disputes between PM and Chancellor. They're collaborating on this to set the stage for discussions. The event was the first time Milburn has shared with Brown since Brown took Polls Polls traditionally. But they chatted amicably, which is interesting because it shows collaboration despite their past conflict.\n\nMr. Brown said he's happy with his campaign task, but someone tried to call out his lack of trust towards Blair, even though Blair later denied it. That adds a twist and shows that the criticism was not entirely accurate from Blair.\n\nThe text also mentions the new posters about British economic conditions\u2014they're enjoying low inflation, unemployment, and low mortgage rates. They urge voters not to let the Tories run things backwards. That's a positive note for Labour in economic terms.\n\nLabour's leader, Tim Raaham, made promises like raising taxes multiple times and having slowest growth in the English-speaking world. But he said they broke promises by doing this instead of focusing on the future. He also mentioned Paul Flynn saying they had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\n\nThen there was a meeting where Blair criticized Labour for trying to unite them with a unified position, urging a third term. Labour responded by stating that in the previous election, their united position helped people get through tough times. But when the book came out, they faced backbenchers who were not supportive. The prime minister and chancellor had an open meeting where the backbenchers discussed what they thought was Mr. Presley telling someone else about Iraq's war.\n\nThe new book claims that the backbenchers organized a dinner in 2003 where Brown told him he would stand down before the next election because Blair lost trust over Iraq. Blair later changed his mind, so it was a tricky situation. The discussions were confidential, and Mr. Prescott mentioned being a waiter for 10 years.\n\nPutting all that together, I need to extract the key points: Labour's efforts to unite, the event details including MPs warning about feuds, the new book on disputes, Blair and Brown's backections, and some specific events like the dinner debate.\n\nI should keep it concise, making sure to include all important elements without getting too detailed. The output is just plain text with no explanations or formatting.\n</think>\n\nLabour sought to unite forces at a campaign event after criticizing Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over their rift.
