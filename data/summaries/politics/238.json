He added: \"Their actions have reflected the pride that most people in this country have in our troops, and have shown a steely determination to make Labour pay for their betrayal. \"I have been honoured to speak at their rallies throughout Scotland.\" Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said it had received a \"big boost\" from the campaign's decision to endorse SNP candidates in four marginal seats.\n \n \"Labour's arrogance has been their undoing.
