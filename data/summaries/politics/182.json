Let me read through the provided text carefully.\n\nFirst, there's a mention of the anti-terror plan testing in Parliament, specifically allowing Home Secretary Clarke to place suspects under house arrest without trial. The Tories, Lib Dems, and Labour MPs are against it, with Clarke promising its success. However, opponents worry about being imposed on the home secretary's words instead of judges.\n\nThe Bill is called \"Prevention of Terrorism,\" proposing control orders in serious cases, curfews, electronic tagging, and limits on accessing information for others. The opposition, especially the Tory shadow Home Secretary David Davis, is worried that this could lock down the home secretary rather than a judge, leading to potential miscarriages of justice.\n\nClarke won't use the house arrest powers now; he said any decision would be reviewed within seven days. Foreign suspects are held at Belmarsh, where laws have been controversial as they break human rights. The new plan is supposed to apply to both UK and foreign terror suspects but will expire on March 14. Opposition MPs are angry with only two days to debate it in the House of Lords.\n\nThe government fears this could overstep civil liberties by allowing politicians to deprivation without trial, which is a big issue for 300 years. They've formed a motion opposing the bill, arguing decisions should be based on stronger proof and that they wrongly infringe liberty by ignoring police advice. They also want urgent action as existing laws run out.\n\nSo I need to condense this into a summary that includes key points: the plan's test in Parliament, opposition reactions, details about control orders, home secretary concerns, restrictions on justice, debate deadline, government's criticism of overstepping liberties, opposing speech, and their opposition.\n\nI should make sure not to include unnecessary details and focus only on the main elements.

The Tories, Lib Dems, and Labour MPs are against this plan, while opponents worry it might restrict justice for politicians rather than judges. The Prevention of Terrorism Bill proposes control orders: house arrest in serious cases, curfews, electronic tagging, and restrictions on telephone and internet access. Opposition, especially the Tory shadow Home Secretary David Davis, fears pressuring politicians to lock up suspects with control orders, fearing legal issues like the Guildford Four case. Clarke will not use house arrest powers now, and his decisions will be reviewed within seven days. Foreign suspects are held at Belmarsh, where laws break human rights. The new plan expires on March 14, but opposition MPs argue only two days will allow debate in the House of Lords. The government is concerned this could overstep civil liberties, arguing politicians should take decisions without trial and ignoring police advice.

Opposition MPs argue that the government should be more cautious in implementing such powers, considering the precedent set by the Guildford Four case where politicians arbitrarily locked up suspects without trial, bringing miscarriage of justice. The current powers expire on March 14th but lawmakers must debate and pass the new plans by Wednesday and next Monday before they can be implemented urgently.
