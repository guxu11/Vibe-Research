{"raw_text": "Housing plans criticised by MPs\n \n \"Irreversible environmental damage\" will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east England, MPs have warned.\n \n \"Sustainable communities\" were being promoted without a real understanding of what \"sustainable\" means, the Environmental Audit Committee said. It said issues like energy needs and transport were not properly addressed. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced. He said: \"We are working across government, especially with our colleagues at Defra, to create cleaner, safer and greener communities, while protecting and enhancing the environment.\"\n \n The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low. Regulations designed to ensure energy-efficient buildings are too lax, and builders routinely flout them anyway, it said.\n \n Financing for improving transport was around one-twentieth of what would be required. The report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially John Prescott's department, BBC environment correspondent Richard Black said. Chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee Peter Ainsworth MP, said: \"The government's housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joined-up policy is crucial. \"I accept the need to improve housing supply but, as things stand, the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers, with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser.\" Points raised in the report included:\n \n \n  - No proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence. \n  - The government should recognise shortcomings of the Treasury's Barker Review, which said 140,000 new homes a year were needed in Britain. \n  - The government should consider a \"national spatial framework\" for England such as those already in place in Scotland and Wales. \n  - The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities. \n  - Measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered - including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero-emissions homes. \n  - The government should make clear how it intends to measure its success at creating sustainable communities. \n  \n \n Conservative local government spokeswoman Caroline Spelman said: \"There is now growing evidence that John Prescott's buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable, leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural England.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "MPs have criticised government plans for building over 1 million homes in south-east England, citing irreversible environmental damage and lack of attention to key issues.

Regulations are lax for energy-efficient buildings, and builders often break these rules. Funding for transport was also insufficient compared to what's needed.\n\nAnother criticism is from Richard Black, who called the report a rebuke to the government and particularly Prescott's department. The chair of the Audit Committee, Peter Ainsworth, pointed out that the housing policy seems disjointed in areas where coordinated policies are crucial. He thinks it's an alarming example of disjointed thinking. He also mentioned that while there might be gains for property developers, the environment is a loser.\n\nThere are several points raised in the report: no further housing proposals should come without strong evidence; the government needs to acknowledge shortcomings from the Treasury's Barker Review, which wanted 140,000 homes annually; considering a national spatial framework like Scotland and Wales. The office of the Deputy Prime Minister should maximize brown field development and homes with higher densities; measures for improving energy efficiency in homes should include reduced stamp duty and a clear timeline for zero-emission homes; and the government needs to outline how they plan to measure success in creating sustainable communities.\n\nConservative MP Caroline Spelman criticized that John Prescott's buildings program is environmentally unsustainable, leaving a \"concrete scar\" in rural England.
