The user has given a detailed text about ministers denying care sums 'wrong' and wants it summarized concisely with key ideas and details preserved. They specifically asked for plain text without explanations or formatting.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the provided text carefully to extract the main points. The text discusses two main issues: the ministers' denial of care costs being 'wrong' and another report suggesting flawed research leading to high costs.\n\nI notice that the report is from the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University, indicating a specific policy on free personal care for the elderly. The key points are:\n- Ministers insist they're committed despite flawed research.\n- A study by Dr. Rhona Brankin has pledged to review the research.\n- Nicola Sturgeon from SNP Holyrood said the public needed reassurance about funding security.\n- Jim and Margaret Cuthbert's team did the initial cost analysis, but Brankin believes assumptions are questionable.\n- The report warns of potential increased costs by \u00a3130m over 2022 if research is flawed.\n- They'll review findings and ensure future funding for care.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a summary. It's important to include all the main points without getting too detailed. Also, since it's plain text, I should avoid any markdown or special formatting. The user wants only the summary as plain text, so I'll make sure to keep it concise and accurate.\n\nI should structure the summary to first mention the ministers denying 'wrong' care sums. Then, introduce the report from the Fraser Institute pointing out flawed research leading to high costs. Mention Dr. Brankin's commitment to researching and Sturgeon's assurance of funding security. Highlight that while they believe their initial assumptions were wrong, they're reviewing everything. Also, note the team's role and any potential increases in costs.\n\nI need to ensure clarity and maintain a logical flow: problem (ministers' stance), research findings (report), commitment from Brankin, Sturgeon's assurance, the team's contribution, review process, funding security, and possible future costs.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure each key point is covered succinctly without adding extra information that wasn't in the original text. That way, the summary is accurate and maintains all critical details.\n</think>\n\nMinisters deny 'wrong' care sums despite flawed research.
