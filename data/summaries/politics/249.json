First, let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe text starts by saying Blair is making a statement, probably because he's busy or facing some obstacle. Then it mentions that \"We answer,\" which sounds like he's answering questions from his rivals. He's referring to the upcoming election campaign and justifying not participating in a debate.\n\nNext, there are quotes from Michael Howard and John Major. Howard says if Blair doesn't go, he'd get scared. That gives some context about why Blair might be cautious or avoid it for safety reasons. \n\nThe text also mentions that before 2001, they tried organizing a debate but faced issues with the format not being agreed on yet.
