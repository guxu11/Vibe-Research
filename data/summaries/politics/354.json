The House of Commons will hear it that day.\n\nNext, the Budget is likely before the General Election, around noon local time (GMT). They'll discuss taxes and economy.\n\nThe Conservative party says they expect some measures to attract votes, maybe more than usual since they've been running the show for a long time.\n\nIn the month of November, this budget was Mr Brown's ninth as Chancellor. If there's an election next May, Labour might have a short Finance Bill rushed through Parliament.\n\nTory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said he can be sure two things: the Budget includes measures to get votes and doesn't include \u00a38 billion in taxes if Labour wins. He urged others to focus on long-term economic needs.\n\nErnst & Young's head of tax suggested they didn't cut taxes immediately after elections, except when there were big changes. They emphasized that past cuts weren't sustainable anymore because other parties won each election.\n\nSo the key points are: budget is before election; Conservative expects some votes, more than usual; previous budgets were as long as Labour terms; potential for a short Finance Bill if election starts May and Labour wins; Letwin's prediction about taxes not increasing if Labour does win. Also, E&Y's warning to focus on economic needs.\n\nI need to make sure the summary captures all that without too much extra fluff.\n</think>\n\nBrown delivers hisBudget on March 16th, before the General Election, announcing measures to attract votes.
