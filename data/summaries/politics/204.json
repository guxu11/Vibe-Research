Let me read through the passage carefully.\n\nThe main points are: The Scottish government dropped plans for a single correctional agency by merging the prison service with local social work departments. They introduced a 'one-stop' system but it was abandoned after opposition from the Scottish Executive. Instead, they'll focus on closer working between the prison and local authorities to reduce reoffending.\n\nThe statistics say over 60% of prisoners are reconvicted within two years. This is causing an expanding prison population. The ministers thought merging might help, but the consultation decision made them drop it. Instead, their Criminal Justice Plan will change the law. Ms Jamieson will start working on ensuring a closer relationship between prison and authorities.\n\nShe'll announce this move on Monday. They want better joint working so more offenders stay in the community. Communities are expected to pay for prison costs, which is another reason why it's important to invest in accountability. Taxpayers must also consider the costs associated with holding those in prison.\n\nSo I need to capture all these key points: merging plan abandoned; focus on closer cooperation; statistics showing high reoffending; change in law; aim for better working relationship; and the reasons taxpayers might be concerned.\n</think>\n\nThe Scottish government has dropped plans for a merged correctional agency.
