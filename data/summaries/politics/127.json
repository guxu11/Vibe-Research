{"raw_text": "Brown to outline presidency goals\n \n Next year will be \"make or break\" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.\n \n The chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.\n \n He also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria. The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries.\"\n \n His proposals were effectively a new \"Marshall Plan\" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued. The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.\n \n Mr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. But with 30,000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed, including 100% debt relief multilaterally. \"That is why next year is a test,\" he said. \"If after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them, then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results.\" The Catholic aid agency Cafod will host Mr Brown's speech on Wednesday.\n \n Cafod wants Britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the US to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. Oxfam's Paying the Price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. The charity's director, Barbara Stocking, said: \"2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure.\" The report said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.\n \n But 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a \"scar\" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. But Band Aid founder Bob Geldof in July said he was sick of hearing \"guff\" about scars on the world. It was pathetic that Britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added. Conservative shadow international development secretary Alan Duncan accused Mr Brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million Africans by 2005. Instead, only 500,000 people would benefit, he said. \"There's no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has,\" added Mr Duncan.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Brown to outline UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies\nGordon Brown will set out key targets for the government, including doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by poor nations.\nHe wants other G8 nations to match his target of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid.\nThe chancellor is traveling to America next week as part of a persuasion drive over aid issues\nBrown proposes a new \"Marshall Plan\" for the world, including an international finance facility to double global aid cash to $100bn per year\nHe also wants developing nations to have trading ability and agrees in the Doha development talks to end export subsidies.", "llama3.2:3b": "Gordon Brown will outline UK goals for EU and G8 presidencies, including:\n- Doubling aid from donor countries\n- Eliminating debt owed by poorest nations\n- Richer countries matching 0.7% national income on overseas aid\n- Increased funding for Aids and malaria vaccines\n- International finance facility to double global aid cash to $100bn a year\n\nBrown aims to pressure G8 nations and the US to meet these targets, while critics argue that Britain has failed to meet existing commitments.", "gemma2:2b": "Chancellor Gordon Brown will outline his goals for UK presidencies of the EU and G8, focusing on doubling aid from donor countries, eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations, and encouraging other G8 nations to match his target of 0.7% national income spent on aid.

President George Bush promised resources to countries which introduced reforms in order to tackle corruption, but America needed increased investment now.\n9. Oxfam's Paying the Price report revealed that over half a billion children will die from hunger as a result of 2015. The aid budgets are halved for these countries' levels.\n10. Despite efforts, Bob Geldof, who is currently at three million, says he had no intention of expecting more benefits to Africa because it's considered a \"scar\" on the world's conscience.\n11. However, in the years since 2005, many organisations members have met the targets, while others have not yet set timelines for aid coverage.\n12.

The chaNCelloor's proposal was a \"Marshall Plan\" to double global aid cash to $100bn annually by 2015, but there is a need for 100% debt relief multi-latally. UK President George Bush has promised to guarantee resources to countries that introduce reform to combat corruption and poverty, but aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. The UK is one of only four G8 members yet to meet the target set for 2005 on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million African beneficiaries.

This represents an increase of nearly 50% over the last four years and follows a commitment made by the previous government in the House of Commons. The Chancellor, Brown, has outlined his plans for these aid targets during his visit to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue.\n\nBrown's proposals include doubling the amount of aid provided from donor countries and ensuring that every poorer country in Africa receives 0.7% of its national income annually to help combat poverty. The UK government will also match this level of foreign aid with funds provided by G8 nations, who must contribute 0.7% of their national income. Brown plans to travel to America next week to showcase his efforts in this area.\n\nHe has also emphasized the importance of trade and investment in developing countries and is planning to establish an International Finance Facility for Development by 2005, which would issue bonds on a global scale to raise money to support overseas aid. The facility will aim to double global aid to $100bn a year by the time it is established. \n\nBrown has also announced that he wants to end the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, which causes trade problems with developing nations. This decision was praised by Agence France-Presse (AFP), who stated: \"The UK government plans to use its influence to push for change on this issue, highlighting the need to address the problem of global injustice.\" The Catholic aid agency Cafod will host Brown's speech on Wednesday.\n\nBrown also criticized America for not providing enough aid to Africa and urged President George W.

She said that Britain has missed its targets in Africa for over two decades and has not yet set a timetable for achieving them. \n\nBrown's proposal for spending \u00a310 billion on overseas aid by 2005 is seen as significant in an area where many organizations members have not reached the target, and his visit to America next week will likely include an announcement about his priorities alongside climate change and the Aids epidemic.", "phi:2.7b": " Brown wants to achieve significant progress in poor countries by doubling aid from donor nations and eliminating debt, as well as getting G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid (0.7% of national income).
