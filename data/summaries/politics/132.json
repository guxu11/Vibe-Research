Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.\n\nFirst, it mentions that the idea of a retirement barrier being a problem is outdated and needs to be exploded. The work and pensions minister, Alan Johnson, has said this. \n\nThen, he talks about the government's consideration of scrapping the retirement age entirely at a conference on aging. This was because they wanted to address issues with older voters, especially the Tories and Lib Dems who are pushing higher pensions.\n\nMr. Johnson also mentioned that the Lib Dems have already adopted the idea of using residency payments instead of national insurance contributions for pensions. The Tories, however, are pledged to boost pensions by tying pensions directly to earnings. He emphasized this because he wants to bring together all parties and strike a consensus on pension reforms, which should focus on tackling pensions for those in poverty and making pensions fairer especially for women.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Johnson mentioned that he's about to unveil plans to change the retirement age system to be increasingly tied to past experience. This would mean people under 65 are consigned to their current ages, while those over 65 have a right to work beyond that age, which employers will need to engage with more seriously. There was also a review in 2011 aiming to test if this is the time to scrap retirement ages entirely, based on evidence showing they're increasingly outdated.\n\nLastly, he said there's a concern that people over 65 are treated as dependents, incapable, and vulnerable\u2014generalised stereotypes of past pensioners. He warns against these perceptions as a form of age discrimination.\n\nPutting this all together, the summary should capture the main points: Johnson supports scrapping the retirement age, Lib Dems have moved to residency-based pensions, Tories aim for higher national insurance, they want a unified approach across parties, and there's concern about stereotyping older workers. \n\nI need to make sure I include all key points without getting too detailed. Maybe structure it by stating that the government is considering scrapping retirement age as outdated, mentioning Lib Dems' stance on residency-based pensions, Tories' focus on linking pensions to earnings, unified approach aimed at 80% employment rate, and the societal concern about stereotypes of older workers.\n</think>\n\nThe government is considering scrapping the retirement age as an outdated barrier that poses issues for contributing society.
