{"raw_text": "Blair blasts Tory spending plans\n \n Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\n \n The prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut \u00a335bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow \u00a34bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n \n \"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\n \n Mr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\n \n Gordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some \u00a350bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\n \n Mr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the \u00a38bn shortfall in their plans?\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Blair attacks Tory spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe first paragraph talks about Blair launching an attack on Conservative spending plans by saying they're absurd and dangerous. He tells a Labour gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure because they'd cut \u00a335bn in \"wasteful\" spending to get \u00a34bn in tax cuts. David Davis said this would come from removing inefficiencies under Labour.\n\n Blair contrasts the reform led by Labour with a hidden Conservative party. He says the Conservatives haven't learned anything, so their plans are just another \"brum\". He mentions that the Conservatives have learned nothing and the New Labour is listening to its voters.\n\n Then Blair lists his government's achievements and tells a rallying call for the party. He mentions the choice between defending the record or building on it and saying they have to fight if they don't keep going. \n\n On another page, Gordon Brown addressed the Conservative plans by stating cuts of \u00a350bn by 2011 but the Tories deny this. Brown warned about party unity and the dangers of letting themselves be distracted.\n\n Then there's a section where Gordon Brown told delegates that we must show strength and unity for long-term decisions to meet their plans. He warned the Tories were planning the biggest cuts ever, while Labour would fund its own plans.\n\n Finally, Oliver Letwin questioned Blair on how Labour would fund their own proposals, saying he can't accept the idea that they should spend more on people matters and lower taxes.\n\n Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the key points: Blair's attack on Conservative spending, Labour's reform vs hidden Conservative, political differences leading to the debate, achievements of Blair, warnings from Brown about party unity, and questions about Labour funding their plans.\n\n Let me structure this into a concise summary without explanations. Start with Blair's launch, mention the cuts by Tories, the contrast between Labour and Tory parties, the warning that they've learned nothing, and then Blair's efforts to defend his record and build on it. Then mention Brown's warnings and the potential cuts. Finally, letwin's questions about Labour's funding.\n\n Make sure to keep it plain text without any formatting or reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTony Blair launched a criticism of Conservative spending plans by calling them \"ludicrous improbability,\" threatening economic failure.
