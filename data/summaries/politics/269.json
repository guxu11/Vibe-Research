They showed little interest in politics and didn't have much knowledge of how political parties work. The text lists who the major parties are: Labour, Tories, and Lib Dems. It also talks about what teenagers could identify or know\u2014like Tony Blair and Michael Howard but less so on others like Charles Kennedy.\n\nNext part is about Ofsted survey: 110 kids were interviewed. Only half said it's not important for them to learn more about politics. One quarter thought Conservatives are in power, while a fifth thought Lib Dems are. They also looked at patriotic symbols\u2014Union flag and fish and chips were top choices. The text notes that many kids identified as British rather than other nationalities and didn't think of themselves as European.\n\nI need to condense this into a summary without any explanations or extra info.
