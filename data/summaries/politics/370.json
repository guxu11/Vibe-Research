{"raw_text": "UK 'discriminated against Roma'\n \n The government's immigration rules racially discriminated against Roma (Gypsies) seeking entry into the UK, the Law Lords have ruled.\n \n It follows a Home Office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people, mostly Roma, from boarding flights to Britain from the Czech capital, Prague. Civil rights group Liberty said it exposed \"racism at the heart of the government's asylum policy\". The Home Office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. It said it would look at the implications of the ruling, but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because Czechs are now entitled to free movement across Europe.\n \n The screening took place at the airport in July 2001, at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering Britain.\n \n Those refused \"pre-clearance\" were effectively prevented from travelling to the UK, because no airline would carry them. Lady Hale, sitting with Lords Bingham, Steyn, Hope and Carswell, said many Roma had good reason to want to leave the Czech Republic because of persecution. But she said they were treated more sceptically than non-Roma passengers by immigration officers \"acting on racial grounds\". Lady Hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way, only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason.\n \n Liberty said statistics suggested Roma Czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by British immigration officials at Prague airport than non-Roma Czechs. It took up the case of six unnamed Roma Czechs refused entry to Britain, and that of the European Roma Rights Centre, which said the measures unfairly penalised Roma people. It lost a High Court action in October 2002 when a judge said the system was \"no more or less objectionable\" than a visa control system. He ruled there was no obligation on Britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum.\n \n The Court of Appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against Roma, but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum. Immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries, but it does not allow officers to go further than that.\n \n Responding to the ruling, a Home Office spokesman said: \"The scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from Prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the UK.\"\n \n Welcoming the ruling, Maeve Sherlock, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \"Human rights abuses against the Roma in Eastern Europe are well documented, and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group.\" Amnesty International's Jan Shaw said: \"That the government's own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse, not least in the Czech Republic.\" But the chairman of Migration Watch UK, Sir Andrew Green, said the House of Lords decision was a \"step in the wrong direction\". \"The basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits.\"\n", "llama3.2:1b": "UK immigration rules discriminated against Roma (Gypsies) by treating them more harshly than others, with many being stopped and refused entry due to concerns about asylum claims.

The ruling was welcomed by Amnesty International, which said it was a step in the wrong direction given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse.\n6.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the government's immigration rules were discriminatory against Roma, which was a big deal because they're Gypsies. They followed the Law Lords' ruling. That must be important\u2014maybe the government wasn't treating Roma any better than others.\n\nThen, there was a move to stop people from boarding flights from Prague. They cut asylum claims by excluding mostly Roma people. Civil rights group Liberty said it exposed racism in the policy. The Home Office didn't mean to discriminate but found controls were no longer there because Czechs are now free to move across Europe. I should note that they now can freely move, which was a shift.\n\nThe screening happened in 2001 when concerns about asylum seekers rising. Roma people, especially from the Czech Republic, were worried about being sent there. But immigration officers treated them more scrutiny than non-Roma. Lady Hale's statements mentioned Roma being treated more sceptically, probably because they were part of a larger population.\n\nLiberty statistics showed Roma Czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by officers at Prague. They took six cases of Roma Czechs and the European Roma Rights Centre. The High Court in October 2002 ruled that the system wasn't objectionable, but now the Court of Appeal said discrimination was justified since Roma are more likely to seek asylum.\n\nThe Home Office's spokesman said the scheme used two years as a short-term response. They welcomed the ruling but pointed out it went beyond sensible limits. Migration Watch UK chairman Sir Andrew Green said the government had a duty to control borders and this decision extended race relations legislation beyond good. The refugees group Amity International agrees that the government was discriminative.\n\nI think I covered all main points: discrimination, controls cutting claims, Roma treated differently, statistics showing higher scrutiny, High Court ruling not changing opinion, Court of Appeal deciding discrimination justified, Home Office response, and the perspective from others.\n</think>\n\nThe UK's immigration policies were deemed discriminatory towards Roma, known as Gypsies, who sought entry via Prague. The Home Office removed controls on asylum claims by excluding most Roma passengers from Czech flights, which raised concerns about their travel to the UK. Civil rights group Liberty highlighted racial discrimination at their immigration officers, while the government did not intend to discriminate but found controls no longer in place. \n\nA screening process at the Czech airport in 2001 revealed Roma people faced higher scrutiny than non-Roma passengers. The government's approach was criticized by statistics showing Roma Czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped, including six cases of Roma Czechs and the European Roma Rights Centre. The High Court ruled that the system wasn't objectionable, despite concerns about potential refugees crossing the border. However, the Court of Appeal found discrimination justified due to Roma's likelihood of seeking asylum. \n\nThe Home Office spokesman noted the two-year policy was a short-term response, while the refugees group, Amnesty International, criticized the government for its human rights abuse.
