Chairman Lord Holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter \"of public interest\". \"The broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead,\" he said.\n \n Lord Holme's proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch US President George W Bush slug it out verbally with his Democratic challenger John Kerry.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that a pre-election debate between three main political leaders was scheduled for televised coverage. The broadcaster's job is to set aside a date, but then the chair might not take part. This comes after a similar event in the US where George W Bush and John Kerry had a debate verbally, which they called \"democratically dubious.\"\n\nThe author, Lord Holme, argues that prime ministers shouldn't have the power to veto on matters of public interest. He claims the broadcasters need to decide whether someone will take part or not. If Blair doesn't want to be there, broadcasters can go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasoning.\n\nLord Holme also mentions that while Howard and Kennedy say they'd welcome it, nobody has directly gotten from the PM. This is because the PM only hears through various intermediaries like aides and campaign managers. So, people might infer Blair isn't interested but haven't asked the PM for that information yet.\n\nThe user-run party leaders are more willing to cooperate with the broadcast rules. They think this makes sense because viewers can compare their positions at home. The idea has public backing from those who value comparing political figures.\n\nLord Holme is also a previous advocate, having campaigned on televised debates. He says broadcasters should make the decision as soon as the election happens, but they need clear rules for fairness and transparency.\n\nIf the PM's statement was true, Blair would have to explain it publicly after the debate. Either the chair can't be there because of hidden veto or they could go with an empty chair, which is preferable. The Hansard Society has done reports before, so they probably support this idea.\n\nBlair has ruled out taking part in the upcoming election campaign. He mentioned that's his answer to \"anyhow,\" and he called it a no. I think he also hinted at a possible shift if his party becomes more active.\n\nSo putting all that together, the summary should cover the main points: the debate arrangement by broadcasters, the role of the chair, the PM's power, public backing, rules for the broadcast, Blair's stance, and the implications for future debates.\n</think>\n\nIf a pre-election televised debate is scheduled between three main political leaders, it could be up to Tony Blair, Michael Howard, or Charles Kennedy to decide who participates.
