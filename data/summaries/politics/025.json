Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe text starts by introducing Barbara Roche, who is a former Home Office minister. She called for an independent body to monitor UK immigration. That seems important because if there are issues like overcrowding and cultural aspects, an independent body could help address them more effectively.\n\nShe mentionsMigration Watch, which she compares to an anti-immigration group that's not actually against all immigration. They say they're just trying to avoid government intervention. But according to Sir Andrew Green, the chair of Migration Watch, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) already provides accurate figures without any interference from the government.\n\nGreen also opposes large-scale immigration because it causes overcrowding and is associated with culture. So he's worried that just allowing people to move there on a larger scale won't solve the underlying problems.\n\nRoche supports this idea and argues that an independent body would provide accurate data and stop anti-immigration groups from influencing decisions. She thinks Migration Watch's existence might be putting pressure on voters, especially in regions like Hornsey and Wood Green where she is running.\n\nThe summary needs to capture the key points: Roche's request for an independent monitor, opposition to anti-immigration groups, concern about large-scale migration leading to overcrowding and cultural issues, and her belief that such a body would address these concerns.\n\nI need to make sure I include all the main ideas without going into too much detail. Also, keep it concise, just plain text without explanations or formatting.\n</think>\n\nBarbara Roche, former Home Office minister, has called for an independent body to monitor UK immigration data. She opposes anti-immigration groups like Migration Watch, which she sees as having no bearing on the government's accurate figures.
