Chief executive John Beaumont was paid a bonus of \u00a344,914, despite a failure to bring in private sector backers. The Commons education select committee called this \"morally indefensible\" but the government said the e-University project had \"improved understanding\".\n \n A Department for Education and Skills spokeswoman said the venture had been \"ambitious and ground-breaking, but take-up had not been \"sufficient to continue with the project\". She added: \"UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom.\" The select committee found that those responsible for founding the e-University in 2000 had been caught up in the \"general atmosphere of enthusiasm\" surrounding the internet. Initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade, bringing in at least \u00a3110m in profit.\n \n But virtually no market research was carried out and just \u00a34.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses. Some \u00a314m went on developing the technology to make the e-University work. This was used by just 200 students, the rest preferring to work through existing university websites. With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had \"too much freedom to spend public money as it wished\", the report found. Committee chairman Barry Sheerman said: \"UK e-University was a terrible waste of public money. \"The senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over-confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme.\" The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but \"should learn the lessons from this disaster\".\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Here is a summary of the text in plain text:\n\nA UK government project called the E-University was cancelled last year after attracting only 900 students and costing \u00a350m.

In order to prevent misuse of these codes, they are created using a complex algorithm. \n\nYou are tasked with creating an algorithm for assigning codes. Here are some rules and parameters:\n1. A code consists of 7 characters - 5 letters and 2 numbers. The codes can't start or end with the number 2.\n2. Each letter must represent a unique character in the English alphabet, from 'a' to 'z'.\n3. Each number must represent an index in the sequence of all possible seven-digit numbers.\n4. No two codes should be identical, except for the first and last characters which are always '1', representing the start and end of the code. \n5. The first letter of each student's name is used to create their unique code.\n\nNow, imagine a situation where you have the following information: \na) Student A's code begins with \"3\" instead of \"1\". \nb) There are two codes that start with \"1\", one belonging to Student B and one to Student C. \nc) Student D's code is exactly as per the algorithm.\nd) Every student except for the last one has a six-digit code.\ne) The code of Student E consists of 6 letters only, no numbers.\nf) All the other students' codes have five letters and two numbers. \n\nQuestion: Based on the given information, can you determine whether Student A's modified code is valid?\n\n\nFirst, we know that all codes except the last one should contain both a letter and a number. Since Student A has changed the first character of his code to \"3\", this means he does not have a letter in his code. \n\nHowever, for each student (except the last) to be unique, their code must also be valid according to the rules: five letters and two numbers. So we can conclude that Student A's modified code is invalid as it doesn't have any number representation.\n\nAnswer: Yes, Student A's modified code is not valid.\n", "orca-mini:3b": " The UK government's attempt to offer online university courses was a \"disgraceful waste\" of public funds, according to a parliamentary report.
