The shadow cabinet was revealed supporting this at a Commons vote before the next week's vote on the bill.\n\nThen, there are details about how some senior Tories opposed the move initially but changed their stance after Michael Howard was Home Secretary. Tory sources mentioned that Howard, who has been with them since he became Home Secretary, likes ID cards and tried to introduce them when he was in office.

They plan to assess costs and privacy with ID cards.\n\nLiberal Democrats oppose the bill, so the summary should reflect that stance too.
