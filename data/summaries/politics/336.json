{"raw_text": "Labour's core support takes stock\n \n Tony Blair has told Labour supporters he's \"back\" and still hungry for the job of prime minister - but does that sum up the mood at the party's spring conference in Gateshead?\n \n \"The electorate are keener on the government than some Labour Party members,\" is the dry assessment of Graham Lane, leader of the Labour group on Newham Council. The problem, according to Mr Lane, is not continuing divisions over Iraq, foundation hospitals or tuition fees, or even voter apathy, but Mr Blair himself. \"I have a new slogan. Vote Blair, Get Brown. That's what I am telling people on the doorstep. Don't worry, he will be gone soon.\" His friend, Saxon Spence, leader of Devon county Labour group, lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others. \"You cannot underestimate the impact of the war in Iraq. We lost people from our local party who had some key roles.\"\n \n But the two friends were fired up by Gordon Brown's speech on Saturday, with its appeal to core Labour values on social justice, health and education.\n \n \"There was real passion. I think we have all felt a little jaded, but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place,\" said Mrs Spence. \"If he hadn't have walked off the stage, they would still be clapping,\" added Mr Lane. But for every Brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of Mr Blair. Stephen Douglas, 26, from Wales, said after the PM's speech on Sunday: \"I think it was a bit of a turning point, given the roasting he has had on some issues. The guy still has it.\"\n \n Tony Martin, of Burnley, said: \"He is the first leader who has won us two terms. This bloke has delivered for us.\" Malcolm Shipley, of Shipley, said it was \"as if he is coming round to the right approach again\". Katrina Bull, a prospective parliamentary candidate said Mr Blair had shown he could rouse the party's grassroots: \"I think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with Tony, the way we have today, we will have no problem with turnout.\" She had just emerged from a Q&A session, in which Mr Blair - tieless and supremely at ease - answered questions posed via the party's website.\n \n A party of councillors from Nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with Mr Blair's leadership - and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever. Iraq, they insisted, would not be a factor for most voters. \"The biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election. \"It might sound great, but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and I think that is the greater problem than Iraq,\" said Nottingham City Councillor Brian Parbutt. And even Mr Blair's most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing - he is a master of the sort of glossy, high-profile campaigning that has become Labour's hallmark, epitomised by Friday's whistle-stop tour of marginal seats. A group of shop stewards from the Swan Hunter shipyard, who said they were facing redundancy, could barely suppress their anger at Mr Blair's failure to, as they saw it, shake off his Tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the North East.\n \n They were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue Sage Centre, heralded by John Prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of Labour's success in urban regeneration.\n \n \"It is no good having the Sage or Baltic if you haven't got the money for the entrance fee,\" said Terry Telford. But when asked about Mr Blair's bravura performance on Friday, the men agreed he was \"brilliant\". And they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the Labour message come election time. \"If you are not fired up about the election, then what's the point? There is no complacency as far as I can see in the Labour Party. We are fired up. We are up for this election,\" said Richie Porterhouse. Mr Telford agreed, but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked \"What has Labour done for the North East?\" \"I have had doors slammed in my face,\" he said.\n \n Every activist I spoke to said they were proud of what they believed Labour had achieved in their local communities - the new hospitals and schools, the better life chances for young people. The problem they faced, they said, was converting this local feelgood factor into votes. But they could at least rely on one \"secret weapon\", as one activist put it - Tory leader Michael Howard.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Labour's core supporters are still enthusiastic about the party, despite some divisions and concerns over leadership. \n\nGraham Lane of Newham Council believes the electorate is more interested in the government than Labour Party members. \nTony Blair is back on board for prime minister but has not addressed specific issues such as Iraq or tuition fees.\n\nSaxon Spence's group leader feels that Gordon Brown's speech rallied the party and reminded them why they joined. \n\nHowever, there are also fans of Tony Blair who praised his leadership after Brown's speech.\n\nLabour councillors from Nottingham agree that Iraq will not be a factor in their voting decisions.\n\nTony Blair is seen as effective at campaigning for Labour, even if he lacks some Tory leanings.\n\nCouncillors face pressure to persuade voters to support the party despite concerns over manufacturing and conference venue costs.", "llama3.2:3b": "Labour's core support remains divided over Tony Blair's leadership amid concerns about his legacy in the aftermath of Iraq.

However, there are some criticisms that have been raised about the party's leadership and decision-making processes. Here are some of the key criticisms:\n\n1. **Lack of transparency**: Some critics argue that Labour leaders are not transparent enough about their decision-making processes and policy choices. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for voters to understand the reasoning behind certain decisions.\n2. **Influence peddling**: There have been allegations that some Labour leaders, particularly Jeremy Corbyn, have used their influence to promote their own interests rather than those of the party or its members. For example, Corbyn has been accused of using his position as leader to benefit his own family and business interests.\n3. **Lack of accountability**: Some critics argue that Labour leaders are not held accountable for their actions in a timely manner. This can lead to a lack of trust in the party's leadership and decision-making processes.\n4. **Corruption allegations**: There have been several high-profile corruption allegations against Labour leaders, including Corbyn, who has faced criticism over his handling of the 2017 general election campaign.\n5. **Lack of diversity**: Some critics argue that Labour's leadership team is not diverse enough and does not reflect the makeup of the party or the UK as a whole. This lack of diversity can lead to a lack of representation for certain groups within the party.\n6. **Influence over the media**: There have been allegations that some Labour leaders, particularly Corbyn, use their influence to shape the narrative around key issues and events. For example, Corbyn has been accused of using his position as leader to promote a particular view on Brexit.\n7. **Lack of experience in government**: Some critics argue that Labour leaders are not experienced enough in government and do not have the necessary skills or knowledge to lead the party effectively.\n8. **Disconnection from the party's base**: There have been allegations that some Labour leaders, particularly Corbyn, do not fully engage with the party's base and do not listen to their views on key issues. This can lead to a lack of trust in the party's leadership and decision-making processes.\n9. **Lack of commitment to social justice**: Some critics argue that Labour leaders are not committed enough to social justice and human rights, particularly when it comes to issues such as poverty, inequality, and racial justice.\n10. **Influence over the judiciary**: There have been allegations that some Labour leaders, particularly Corbyn, use their influence to shape the direction of the judiciary and promote certain cases or policies.\n\nThese criticisms are not necessarily universally accepted, and many voters and experts remain loyal to the Labour Party's leadership and decision-making processes.
