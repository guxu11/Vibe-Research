He preferred to state that, as with other issues like ID cards, the government's immediate instinct was authoritarian.\n \n As is his habit nowadays, the prime minister was less rough with Mr Kennedy than he had been with Mr Howard - he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the Lib Dems have, once again, just missed the point.
