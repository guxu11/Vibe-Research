{"raw_text": "Howard pitches for UK ethnic vote\n \n Michael Howard is to make a pitch for Britain's ethnic vote urging people who feel \"taken for granted\" by Tony Blair to vote Conservative.\n \n He will say Conservatives \"share the same values\" as the UK's minorities. And that he wants to build a \"better Britain\" where everyone, whatever the colour of their skin or religion, can \"make the most of their talents\". But the Tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is \"outdated and unjust\".\n \n \"It sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities,\" he will argue. Mr Howard - himself the son of immigrants - will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the UK. \"People from ethnic communities, for example, still earn less than their white counterparts,\" he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was \"free enterprise, free trade, free speech\". The Tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that Hindus and Sikhs as well as Muslims got \"caught in the downdraft of Islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of 9/11\".\n \n Mr Howard will make his speech during a visit to support Tory Parliamentary hopefuls Robert Light and Sayeeda Warsi - \"the first British Muslim woman\" selected to run for MP as a Conservative candidate.

Lib Dem president Simon Hughes branded Mr Howard \"arrogant and wrong\" for claiming the Tories were the \"natural party\" for Britain's ethnic minorities. \"Given the Tories' considerably reduced support in urban areas, where many black and Asian Britons live, during their time in power, the evidence simply does not support his claims that the Conservatives are the party for these communities,\" he said.\n", "llama3.2:1b": "Howard will make a pitch for the UK's ethnic vote, arguing that Conservatives share values with minorities and want to build a \"better Britain\" where everyone can succeed.
